The city is home to many manufacturers and in recent years has experienced rapid growth in the diversity of its cultural offerings.\n\nAmong the activities to catch when visiting Taichung: the world-class science museum and hiking in the nearby hills. There are also many famous night markets that provide night-time excitement.  Here you can enjoy delicious food and drink, and find cheap and interesting items for sale. These include the ChungHwa night market (中華夜市), the Feng-Chia university night market (逢甲夜市), the Tung-Hai university night market (東海夜市), and the Chung-Shiao night market (忠孝夜市).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Aboriginal era"]},"\n\nTaiwanese aborigines originally populated the plain where modern Taichung City is located. They lived by cultivating millet and taro and hunted deer. Several local names in central Taiwan contain the word for \"deer,\" including Shalu Township and Lukang Township in Changhua County.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Early history of Taichung"]},"\nTaichung was founded in 1705 as a part of Changhua County with the name of Dadun (ch: 大墩; p: Dàdūn; w: Ta-tun; lit. large mound). At this point in history, the Qing Dynasty, formed by invading Manchus in the 1640s, was consolidating its hold on western Taiwan, which it had wrested from the Cheng family in 1682. As a part of strengthening its control, a garrison was founded in 1721 near the site of present-day Taichung Park by Lan Ting-chen.\n\nAll was not peaceful for Qing authorities in central Taiwan. North of the city, at the Dajia River, an aboriginal revolt broke out in 1731 after Chinese officials moved in and compelled them to provide labor. After being joined by other aboriginals, they drove as far south as the county seat of Changhua in May, 1732 before being chased into the mountains by Qing forces.\n\nAnother rebellion, this one in 1786, against Qing authorities had its roots in the nearby town of Dali, just south of Taichung City. Led by Lin Shuang-wen, it began as an attempt to overthrow the Manchu government and restore the Ming Dynasty. Unfortunately, as they moved northward, they turned to slaughter and looting. They were eventually defeated by a coalition of Hakka, Quanzhou Fujianese descendants, and Aboriginal volunteers who joined with the government to defeat the rebels.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Qing Dynasty rule era"]},"\n\nTaiwan became a province of Qing-dynasty China in 1885, and the city, named Taiwan at the time, was named capital of Taiwan Prefecture, one of three prefectures in the newly created Taiwan Province. It was also initially designated as the provincial capital, and Qing official Liu Mung-chuan received the authority from the Guangxu Emperor to oversee development of the area. However, four years later, Liu was forced to “retire” by Empress Dowager Cixi, and the provincial capital was moved to what is now known as Taipei.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Japanese colonial era"]},"\n\nChina lost the Sino-Japanese War in 1895. As a consequence, the Qing Dynasty was forced to surrender Taiwan to the Japanese in the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The Japanese changed the name of the city from Dadun to Taichū (台中), and began to develop the city, setting out to make it the first “modern” area of Taiwan.\n\nHowever, Taichū bore the brunt of early Japanese repression. There were many rebels who stated that they had accepted amnesty from the earlier period of rebellion when the Republic of Taiwan was declared in 1895. However, many of those same people continued anti-Japanese activities. On May 25, 1902, some 360 rebels and their families accepted invitations to surrender and receive amnesty and rewards. Instead of receiving amnesty, once inside, the Japanese locked the doors and slaughtered the former rebels.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Taichung Park bridge.JPG"],["thumb"],["Taichung Park"]]}," Taichū Park was completed in 1903. The old north gate, one of the few Liu-era structures to survive the Japanese reconstruction of the city, was moved to the new park. To this day, Taichung Park is one of the most popular places in the city for people to relax.\n\nThe first market in Taichū was built in 1908 along JiGuang Road between ZhongZheng and ChengGong Roads. It is still used today, and is a popular spot to purchase food and other items in downtown Taichung. Taichung Middle School (now known as Taichung First High School) was founded in 1913 by Lin Hsien-tang and his brother Lin Lie-tang, two wealthy Taiwanese intellectuals of the era. This was done in an effort to teach children the traditional culture of Taiwan and to foster a sense of local pride.\n\nTaichū was officially designated as a city by Japanese Imperial authorities in 1920, and Taichū City Hall was completed in 1924 after eleven years of construction.\n\nA Taiwanese cultural association founded in 1921 in Taipei by Lin Hsien-tang was moved to Taichū in 1927. Most of the members of this association were from Taichū and the surrounding area. The city became a center of Taiwanese culture and nationalism.\n\nThe newfound prosperity of Taichū was eventually squandered by the war effort. When World War II ended in 1945, Taiwan’s economy, like Japan’s, was in shambles.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Republic of China era (1945-)"]},"\n\nThe Japanese were forced to surrender to Republic of China forces on behalf of Allied forces on 1945-10-25, who came across the Strait on U.S. ships and accepted their surrender on behalf of the Allied Powers.\n\nThe Kuomintang (KMT), also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party, relocated the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan upon losing the Chinese Civil War to the Communists.\n\nThe early post-war era was one of transition and turmoil for Taiwan. Taiwanese nationalists had divided into three prominent groups, one of which was known as the Taichung Clique. These were men with relatively high social standing during the Japanese era, such as Lin Hsien-t’ang, Yang Chao-chia, Yeh Jung-chung, and others. These men attempted to take what they believed to be their rightful place as the political leaders of the island. However, the administrator of the island, Chen Yi, opposed this faction as it contained many people, especially merchants and landlords, who had opposed his policies.\n\nUnder the authorities of the Republic of China, Taichung had become the center for organized crime and associated businesses.\n\nOn 2010-12-25, Taichung City and County of Taiwan Province merged into a new a special municipality of Taichung.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Districts"]},"\n\nTaichung is divided into 29 geographical subdivisions, including the following 8 in Taichung City before 2010-12-25:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Beitun District"]},", (北屯區): Geographically, this is the largest district in the city, spreading from the north to the northeastern-most reaches of the city.

It is often compared to California because of the frequency of sunny dry days. The subtropical monsoon climate gives Taichung south wind from June to August and north wind from October to May. The highest temperature appears in the summer months of July, August, and September, and the lowest temperature arrives in the winter months of January and February. The difference in temperature between summer and winter seldom exceeds about 16c. However, there will be short periods during the winter when the temperature barely rises much above 10c. The city enjoys mild weather throughout the year, with the average annual temperature being a comfortable 23c. The average annual rainfall is around 1600 mm. The rain falls generously in the wet season (May – August) and scarcely in the dry season (October – February). The unique landform of basin means that the city is suffers less from typhoons than other areas in Taiwan.  However, typhoons still affect the city and often bring very heavy rainfall and flooding.  However, by being in a valley and not having much rain, Taichung also has air quality problems throughout the year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBus is the most convenient and least expensive option. From Taipei Train Station, go to the bus terminal and take the U-Bus (統聯客運), Kuo-Kuang Bus (國光客運).  Tickets cost from NT$100–350, depending on what day of the week you travel on.  Buses depart several times an hour from the early morning through evenings and the entire ride is about three hours long.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nAll Taiwan High Speed Rail (HSR) trains between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taipei"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaohsiung"]]}," stop at Taichung.  The High Speed Rail station is located on the outskirts of Taichung.  You can take a regular train between the two stations in about six minutes, in addition, a free bus is available to take HSR passengers downtown, to the universities, etc.\n\nIn addition, Taichung is a major stop along the Western Line with all north and south bound trains a making a stop here.  Express trains (ZiQiang) are NT$375 from Taipei and NT$470 from Kaohsiung.  Midrange ticket prices (Jukuang class) typically run around NT$289 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taipei"]]}," or NT$363 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaohsiung"]]},". The entire trip takes about three hours from both Taipei and Kaohsiung.

Due to traffic and parking issues, driving yourself is NOT recommended for typical travel within Taichung.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nTaichung airport operates mostly as domestic hub, though it does also offer a limited international service to neighboring counties. A flight to Taipei takes 40 minutes, although air service to Taipei has been cut back lately as the High Speed Rail is generally a faster and more convenient way to get there.\n\nAn international terminal is being built currently in Taichung and is going to be the largest airport in Taiwan and the terminal's floor area is more than 800,000 square meters. This airport is normally compared to the Beijing Capital International Airport T3, The Changi International Airport T3 in Singapore, and other big airports around the world. This new airport will offer at least 80 airlines and more than 70 restaurants. This airport was scheduled to be finished by the end of 2009.  However, as of early 2011 this expansion has not yet been completed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nCompared to Taipei and Kaohsiung, Taichung's public transit system is much more limited.  There is no MRT system but bus service is frequent on Taizhonggang Road (臺中港路) from the train station to the west side of town.  Buses also run frequently from the train station along SanMin Road to BeiTun District.  As of May 2009, a more improved bus system has been implemented but only runs until 10PM.  Most fares are about NT25 per ride.  An refillable fare card is available but not required.\n\nAs of summer 2010, eight bus lines (Routes #51-58) run from various points around the city free of charge.  A few of these routes require a traveler to walk several hundred meters to the northeast along JianGuo Road (建國路) to reach the beginning of these free routes.\n\nTraveling by scooter is the most convenient option.  Renting a scooter can be done with a Taiwanese driver's license or an International Driving Permit accompanying the original foreign license.  Otherwise, you will need to take taxis.  Taxis are convenient, and fares start at NT$85 at flagfall.  Tips are not required.  The downtown area is sufficiently compact to make it easy to get around on foot, although many shop owners will utilize the sidewalk in front of their business.  This can make walking something of an ordeal, dodging traffic as you are forced to walk on the street.\n\nAn MRT system in the city is under construction and the first line from the High speed Rail Station to Fengyuan should be completed somewhere in 2014.
