For example, you will not find much of the deep fried dim sum found in larger Guangdong cities. Likewise, instead of fried rice\/noodles common in Chinatowns across the world, steaming in stainless steel cabinets is the cooking style of choice.\n\nThe most famous dish in Taishan is Stone Bowl Eel Rice \"Wong Seen Fon\".  In Guangdong's major cities, a scattering of restaurants will have \"Toisan Wong Seen Fon\" as a specialty but Taishan is the place to go to experience the original, especially Shuibu Town.  Rice is first cooked halfway before being mixed with precooked eel in a clay pot.  The clay pot is then fired up to finish cooking the rice.  Where the rice touches the clay pot, oil from the precooked eel drips down and makes a crispy layer called \"fon jil\".  (Taishanese call this layer \"nuong\" which is also the word for burnt.)\n\nAlso popular amongst Taishan locals are restaurants that serve western, Cantonese and coffee\/tea.  In the local language, this is referred to as \"Cha Chaan Teang\" which roughly translates to Tea Cuisine.  If you have a hankering for sandwiches, steaks, pizza or spaghetti, you can halfway satisfy your need.  The western foods are cooked in a style similar to \"Hong Kong style fast food\" you might find in Chinatowns across the world.  \n\nFinally, Taishanese love late night dining.
