There are also daily connections to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangzhou"]]}," (26 hours) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]}," (15 hours). The station is brand new and located very far from the city. Local bus 26 (¥2) runs into downtown, taking around 30 minutes, and a taxi should also be very cheap. The station is simple enough to use - there are 2 waiting rooms spread over 2 floors (2nd and 3rd floor) and 3 platforms. The ticket office is fairly quiet at most times and you never have to wait more than 5 minutes, although the staff don't speak English.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are regular buses to Nanjing, Nantong, Yancheng, Yangzhou etc as well as a few per day running to Shanghai. The bus station is a little closer to the city than the train station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Taizhou Street.jpg"],["thumb"],["A street in the downtown part of Taizhou Jiangsu"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nTaking a bus is fairly simple - the city centre is compact and runs in a straight line along Zhongshan Lu. Most buses are ¥1 although the 26 to the train station is ¥2 - the fare is written on the farebox. Exact change is required. Most buses run from 5am to 10pm. Schedules are in Chinese only, as are the on-board announcements although if you have a basic knowledge of Chinese they're easy to follow.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis are plentiful and cheap with flagfall starting at ¥7.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\nAs car traffic is very light in Taizhou, riding a bike can be a fast, fun and fairly safe way of travelling. Bicycles can be purchased cheaply in  a supermarket on for around 200 for a simple single-speed city bike that will fall apart after 1 week to about  600 for a 21-speed mountain bike. Second-hand bikes can be bought from small shops around the city - quality is varied. If you wish to use a higher-quality bike such as a Merrida or Giant they can also be purchased for 600-200+ If you want to go a bit faster, e-bikes and 50cc scooters are also popular - e-bikes are sold along a street called Qingnian Road with many many choices available anywhere from 700-4000. Whilst not such a huge problem as in the big cities, bike theft does occur so make sure your ride is locked up safely.\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\nAs it's very compact, uncrowded and has less traffic, walking around Taizhou is very pleasant. Especially by the FengChengHe (River)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nTaizhou is still growing and foreigners are such a rarity in Taizhou that it's a great place to practice your Chinese as everyone will be eager to talk to you. Many Taizhouren study in nearby Yangzhou or Nanjing, so at the weekends and holidays it's common to find students who can speak English and might show you around.\n\nAlso, there are many who study at the Nanjing Taizhou University College who can speak English as well.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Guangxiao Si (temple)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Lao Jie (old street)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Mei Lan Fan Museum "]},{"type":"*","value":[" Yuan Bo Yan "]},{"type":"*","value":[" Qing Hu, actually in Jiangyan but worth the taxi if going with 4 people"]},{"type":"*","value":[" TaiShan Park"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe central part of Taizhou has some overpriced shopping malls such as the Golden Eagle (Jing Ying) and Taizhou One Hundred Shopping Mall. (Yi Bai) \nWanda offers some more competitive prices such as C&A but still has very expensive prices. \n\nTo go shopping in Taizhou is difficult and the selection is poor. Many people shop online due to high prices.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThe area around pozijie has lots of cheaper eats such as KFC, fast food places, noodle shops. \n\nThe recently developing Wanda Shopping Centre has lots of western food, but is inconsistent in quality. Average, but tasty curries, steaks restaurants and an expensive buffet restaurant called \"toronto's\" are among some of the selections offered in Wanda.\n\nIn Taizhou, it seems to be consensus among the local English speaking foreigners that the best restaurants appear to be family owned and are located in various parts of the city. There are some excellent places to eat in \"Lao Jie\" the so called Old street of Taizhou there are some of the classic dishes 'gan si', 'bao zi' and 'mien'\n\nCloser to Wanda a few streets over is a Korean owned restaurant with excellent Kimchi pancakes and Bi Bim Bap. It should be located on Gulou South Road, and its called Dafeng SanqianLi. There are two Korea restaurants, but the one with the entrance on the left side is better. Its nearby a china construction bank, and down the road from the KFC on the corner of the intersection of Jichuan East road\n\nA place called \"Shui Ren Tang\" has excellent 'Jou' or porridge as well as Ribs and chinese buns.  It's located on Gulou North Road and is nearby the \"Hui bin Lou\" \n\nThere are a few BBQ streets with people from Xinjiang mostly selling meat that you can roast on an open flamed bbq. Sitting on small stools and sipping beers while eating lamb, beef, and chicken are a favourite pastime for many in Taizhou.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nNightlife in Taizhou typically involves ordering beers and going out. If you have a group of friends, going to one of the many KTV's is a great way to spend the evening - order some beers, choose some songs (English, Korean and Japanese songs are  also available but usually you have to know he name of the song, sometimes things are misspelling but if you are persistent there are lots of Foreign songs available.)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n--Low end--\n\nHome Inn is located near Pozijie on Renmin Street. It has parking in the back and offers inexpensive but likely hard beds. \n\n--High End--\n\nThe doubletree hilton is a hotel near Wanda in Taizhou that offers western style rooms at a higher price. They have a nicely decorated interior with impressive displays. It more fancy but the cost is higher but the beds are good.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\nSome of the best way to connect with people is to try to start up a conversation with them in places like the gym, bars, or in clothing stores. People in Taizhou are still not used to foreigners and will treat foreigners in a very friendly way.\n\nTry not to be put off by strange fascination, as most people have the best intentions. \n\nThe local dialect is \"Taizhouhua\", people will be amazed if you can speak a few words such as \"ma-da-ming\"- which roughly translates to \"oh my god\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nYangzhou is nearby Taizhou and is a similar kind of feeling but has lots of gardens and is worth the trip.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["http:\/\/en.wikivoyage.org\/wiki\/Yangzhou"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Jiangsu"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Taizhou, Jiangsu"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["32.483056"],["119.9"]]}]
