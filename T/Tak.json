Later the area was an important western gateway of the Sukhothai Kingdom. \n\nVarious \"the greats\" had their armies based in the region and are so associated with Tak: King Ramkhamhaeng the Great, King Naresuan the Great, King Narai the Great, and King Taksin the Great.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, King Rama II moved Tak from the right to the left bank of the Ping River. This established the current Tak as a distinct place from the older town (today's Ban Tak).\n\nThe region's mountains and forests contain many national parks, such as Taksin Maharat National Park, Mae Moei National Park, Lan Sang National Park, and Namtok Pha Charoen National Park, and various waterfalls.
