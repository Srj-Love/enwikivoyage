The system is so good and there are so many bikes available that many locals use the system as well, unlike most rental cycles in Japan which are designed exclusively for tourists.  You can rent a bike for just ¥100 per day ... and by \"day\" they don't mean until the end of said day, they mean a full 24-hour period from the moment you rent the bike.  So, if you arrive in the afternoon, stay one night, and then leave in the morning; that only requires one \"day\" of bicycle rental and ¥100.  Even better, you can keep your bike overnight, so there are no problems biking to a hotel in the evening and then returning the bike in the morning.  It is possible to rent the same cycle for up to 72 hours　– all you have to do is inform the staff when you rent the bike that you want it for more than 24 hours.

If you walk out of the station, just look for some stairways leading underground with bike signs above.  One key aspect of the rental process is that you will need a photo ID to rent a bike for the first time.  Before your first rental you'll be asked to fill out a short application and submit some kind of official photo ID.  A few minutes later you'll be issued a renter ID card and for future rentals you will only need this card.  Travelers are unlikely to need a card for subsequent rentals, but the few minutes spent filling out the application to get a Takamatsu rental cycle will without a doubt pay off big time when it comes to exploring the city.

Udon noodles are distinctive in that they are white, fairly thick, and chewy.\n\nKagawa Prefecture is famous for this food, and the type made within the prefecture is sometimes called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sanuki udon"]},", 'Sanuki' being Kagawa's name before the modern era.  While this can be considered a regional specialty of Kagawa, the Sanuki variety is so widely-loved throughout Japan that it is often thought of as the 'normal' type, and is what most people imagine when they hear the word 'udon'.  Despite udon being so widespread, Takamatsu does it better and cheaper than anywhere else in the country.  There are literally hundreds of udon shops within the city limits.  Because local foods are often a driving force in Japanese tourism, many people flock to the city for the udon, often doing \"chain-eating\" tours around the city to famous shops.\n\nUdon is an extremely budget-friendly food, and it's a simple but tasty item that is easy to eat even for those who don't especially take to Japanese food, so travelers should make an effort to at udon ",{"type":"''","value":["at least"]}," once while in Takamatsu.\n\nThe average Takamatsu udon shop has a variety of udon dishes available.  These are some of the standard types:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Kake udon"]}," — (Hot) The most basic variety.  The noodles come in a hot dashi and soy-flavored broth and will likely have sliced onions thrown in.  Some places may also add a slice of kamaboko (fish sausage) as well.

It's rare for a typical bowl of udon to exceed ¥1000, and not uncommon for the simpler types to hover around ¥400.  ¥100 bowls are even available at some places.  Feel free to ask locals about good udon shops – they are sure to know some.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Tsurumaru"],["alt=手打ちうどん 鶴丸"],["url="],["email="],["address=古馬場町9-34"],["lat=34.342497"],["long=134.05237"],["directions=About halfway between Kataharamachi Station and Kawaramachi Station on the road running along the Kotoden Line."],["phone = +81 87 821-3780"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=11AM-2PM, 8PM-3AM"],["price=&yen400-1200 per bowl"],["content=One of the more noteworthy udon shops in town.
