The first church was replaced and rebuilt around 1703. But this church, dedicated to Saint-Anne, was devastated by a fire in June 1872. Another church was then built (actual church). It has been consecrated in 1882 by the archbishop of that time.\n\nJudicaël and Erispoë, kings of Brittany, had a residence from the 7th to the 9th century in Talensac. Erispoë lived in the village of the \"Châtellier\" next to the road of Breteil. This fortification was protected as it had moats. On 2 November 857, Erispoë was assassinated in the church of Talensac by Salomon, his first cousin, who didn't want Erispoë's daughter to marry the son of Charles le Chauve. This would have brought into play the lands of Salomon and the independence of Brittany faced to West Francia, but also all the chances of Salomon to access to the throne.\n\nIn 1152, Guillaume I spouse gave Saint-Jacques de Montfort abbey, the taxes of Talensac and the mill of the town to monks. The son of Guillaume I and of Amice de Porhoët, Godefroy de Montfort, left \"Le pré au Comte\" in 1171. Around 1372, the castle of the \"Châtellier\", property of the Bintin family, was devastated.\n\nIn 1697, Jeanne-Françoise De Massuel, Lady of the Bois-de-Bintin, married the Lord of Belin, Mathurin Lesné, in Talensac. He and his spouse lived in the castle of \"Bédoyère\", an imposing residence from the 17th century. The castle, badly preserved during the different periods it went through, was demolished around 1920.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get In"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nTake RN24 (Rennes \/ Vannes-Lorient) and exit Talensac-Montfort.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe closest airport is in Rennes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nRailway station of Montfort-sur-Meu, direct lines from Rennes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nIllenoo Bus, line 2 : Breteil, Iffendic, La Nouaye, Montfort-sur-Meu, departing from the railway station of Rennes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Saint Méen Church"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=It is dated 19th century but the cross next to it is dated 16th century."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Eminescu park(Talensac)"]}," Cross the Eminescu park to have a view on the Meu valley."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Circuit of the pond of Le Guern (Talensac)"]}," The path has a few quite steep hills."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Circuit of Trieneuc\/Val-Beuzet\/Les Auriais (Talensac)"]}," The circuit offers a panorama on Montfort-sur-Meu, Bédée and Breteil.
