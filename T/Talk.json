Travel can bring you into contact with any of these.\n\nThis article tries to give an overview of how to cope with language difficulties, an important problem for many travellers.

Keep sentences short. Use the present tense. Avoid idioms. Use single words and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gestures"],["hand gestures"]]}," to convey meaning.\n\nIf none of those work for your situation, you can just smile a lot and use gestures. It is amazing how far this can take you; many people are extremely tolerant.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Using English"]},"\nIf you can't get your message across in the local language, then as an English speaker you are fortunate that many people around the world learn English as a second language. Many entire nations are completely fluent in English, and in even more you can expect a limited knowledge - especially among younger people. English has also emerged as the international language in science, with over 90% of modern scientific journal articles being published in English, so academics working in scientific fields in reputable universities around the world generally have a functional command of English.\n\nHowever, how much effort locals will expend in trying to understand and communicate with you is another matter, and varies between individuals and cultures. To some it comes as a complete surprise that a foreigner would attempt to learn any of their language. To others, it is offensive to start a conversation without at first a courtesy in the local language and a local language request to speak English. There is often no correspondence between ability and willingness to speak a language, many people are lacking in confidence, or don't have the time.\n\nAs always, be aware of local norms. You'll get a stern look in Frankfurt if you waste a shopkeeper's time trying out your elementary school German, and the interaction will quickly switch to English. However, in Paris, an initial fumbled attempt in French may make your conversational companion much more comfortable. In a Tokyo restaurant, you may get all of their student waiters gathered around your table to try out their English, while they giggle at any attempt you make in Japanese. Obviously, in general, you shouldn't have the expectation that everyone you meet in your travels will speak English.\n\nNearly anywhere, if you stay in heavily touristed areas and pay for a good hotel, enough of the staff will speak English to make your trip painless. \n\nThe map below shows the percentage of English-speakers overall by nation. Keep in mind, however, that this can be quite misleading as English speaking ability can vary dramatically within countries. In nations where English is not the primary language, English-speakers are more likely to be found in major cities and near major tourist attractions. In ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]},", for example, there is a higher concentration of English-speakers in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osaka"]]},", but the percentage drops significantly when you travel to more rural parts, like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shikoku"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyushu"]]},". South Africa can be considered an English speaking country while travelling through areas a visitor would normally visit, but the national percentage reflects the use of local languages in rural towns and communities.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:World map percentage english speakers by country.png"],["thumb"],["center"],["480px"],["English-speaking % of population by country (grey=no data)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regional languages"]},"\nIn many areas, it is very useful to learn some of a regional language.

For example, \"OK\" and \"bye-bye\" are used in Chinese and many Chinese speakers also know \"hello\" and \"thank you\". Unless you are dealing with academics or people working in the tourism industry, however, that may well be the extent of their English.\n\nFrench words also turn up in other languages. \"Merci\" is one way to say \"thank you\" in Persian and in Bulgarian.\n\nEnglish idioms may also be borrowed. \"ta-ta\" is common in India, for example.\n\nAbbreviations like CD and DVD are often the same in other languages. \"WC\" (water closet) for toilet seems to be widely used, both in speech and on signs, in various countries, though not in most English-speaking ones.\n\nWords from the tourist trade, such as \"hotel\", \"taxi\", and \"menu\", may be understood by people in that line of work, even if they speak no other English.  \n\nSome words have related forms across the Muslim world.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" \"Thank you\" is ",{"type":"''","value":["shukran"]}," in Arabic, ",{"type":"''","value":["teshekkür"]}," in Turkish, ",{"type":"''","value":["tashekor"]}," in Dari (Afghan Persian), ",{"type":"''","value":["shukria"]}," in Urdu."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["In'shallah"]}," has almost exactly the same meaning as English \"God willing\".
