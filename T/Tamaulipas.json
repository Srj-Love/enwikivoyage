The big problem now is the cartel wars (CDG, Z) that are terrifying all Tamaulipas. Traveling north to south has become very dangerous.\n\nThe San Fernando area (around 100 km from the north) is one dangerous spot these days. In this region was the discovery of an illegal graveyard where they found more than 100 bodies, some of them were slaughtered with cruelty by the Z cartel. So not visit Tamaulipas now. If you really have to, take some measures not to draw attention from drug cartels (no fancy clothes, not too much money, etc).\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["24.287222"],["-98.563333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Mexico"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Tamaulipas"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North America\/Mexico\/States\/Tamaulipas\/"]]}]
