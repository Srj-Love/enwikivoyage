[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tamil"]}," (தமிழ் tamiḻ) is a language and  the language closest to Proto-Dravidian among the Dravidian language family. Spoken predominantly by Tamils in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore, it has smaller communities of speakers in many other countries. As of 1996, it was the eighteenth most spoken language, with over 74 million speakers worldwide. It is one of the official languages of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sri Lanka"]]},".\n\nTamil is one of the longest surviving classical languages in the world. It has been described as \"the only language of contemporary India which is recognizably continuous with a classical past\" and having \"one of the richest literatures in the world\". Tamil literature has existed for over 2000 years. The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and hero stones date from around the 3rd century BCE. The earliest period of Tamil literature, Sangam literature, is dated from ca. 300 BCE – 300 CE. Tamil language inscriptions written c. 1st century BCE and 2nd century CE have been discovered in Egypt, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The two earliest manuscripts from India, to be acknowledged and registered by UNESCO Memory of the World register in 1997 and 2005 were in Tamil. More than 55% of the epigraphical inscriptions (about 55,000) found by the Archaeological Survey of India are in the Tamil language. According to a 2001 survey, there were 1,863 newspapers published in Tamil, of which 353 were dailies. It has the oldest extant literature amongst other Dravidian languages. The variety and quality of classical Tamil literature has led to its being described as \"one of the great classical traditions and literatures of the world.\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\n\n; a : like 'a' in \"apple\", 'a' in \"cake\", \"a\" in \"amen\"\n; e : like 'e' in \"magazine\", 'e' in \"bed\" (often silent at the end of a word)\n; i : like 'i' in \"pine\", 'i' in \"fin\"\n; o : like 'ow' in \"low\", like 'o' in \"top\"\n; u : like 'oo' in \"hoop\", like 'u' in \"cup\"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consonants"]},"\n\n; b : like 'b' in \"bed\"\n; c : like 's' in \"supper\", 'k' in \"kid\"\n; d : like 'd' in \"dog\"\n; f : like 'ph' in \"phone\"\n; g : like 'g' in \"go\", 'j' in \"jello\"\n; h : like 'h' in \"help\" (often silent in the UK and other Commonwealth countries)\n; j : like 'dg' in \"edge\"\n; k : like 'c' in \"cat\"\n; l : like 'l' in \"love\"\n; m : like 'm' in \"mother\"\n; n : like 'n' in \"nice\"\n; p : like 'p' in \"pig\"\n; q : like 'q' in \"quest\" (with \"u\", almost always)\n; r : like 'r' in \"row\", like 'r' in \"feather\" (often silent in the UK and other Commonwealth countries at end of word)\n; s : like 'ss' in \"hiss\", like 'z' in \"haze\"\n; t : like 't' in \"top\"\n; v : like 'v' in \"victory\"\n; w : like 'w' in \"weight\"\n; x : like 'cks' in \"kicks\", like 'z' in \"haze\" (at beginning of a word)\n; y : like 'y' in \"yes\", like 'ie' in \"pie\", like 'ee' in \"flee\"\n; z : like 'z' in \"haze\"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Common diphthongs"]},"\n\n; ay : like 'ay' in \"say\"\n; ai : like 'ay' in \"say\"\n; au : like 'awe'\n\n; ee : like 'ee' in \"see\"\n; ei : like 'ay' in \"say\"\n; ey : like 'ay' in \"say\", like 'ee' in \"see\"\n\n; ie : like 'ee' in \"see\"\n\n; oi : like 'oy' in \"boy\"\n; oo : like 'oo' in \"food\", like 'oo' in \"good\"\n; ou : like 'ow' in \"cow\", like 'oo' in \"food\", like 'o' in \"cot\"\n; ow : like 'ow' in \"cow\"\n; oy : like 'oy' in \"boy\"\n\n; ch : like 'ch' in \"touch\"\n; sh : like 'sh' in \"sheep\"\n; th : like 'th' in \"this\", like 'th' in \"those\"\n; gh : like 'f' in \"fish\"\n; ph : like 'f' in \"fish\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Phrase list"]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Basics"]},"\n\n; Hello. : வணக்கம்\n: Vaṇakkam\n; Hello.
