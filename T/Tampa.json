West Tampa, once a separate city, lies across the Hillsborough River to the west of Downtown. South Tampa, a large residential area, extends south along the Interbay Peninsula. Historic Ybor City (sometimes considered a part of downtown) lies on the northeast side of downtown. East Tampa, the historically African-American side of the city, lies north of Ybor City. North Tampa forms the urban\/suburban sprawl north of Busch Boulevard. A significant suburban area, often considered a part of \"Tampa\", extends many miles to the northwest, north, and east of the city.\n\nWithin Tampa proper, there are six official \"historical districts\" (Hampton Terrace, Hyde Park, Seminole Heights, Tampa Heights, Historic West Tampa, Ybor City) and at least 86 named neighborhoods.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe Tampa Bay area was visited by many Spanish explorers, beginning with Panfilo de Narvaez in 1528.  However, no long term permanent settlements were created until 1824 when the US federal government created a reservation for north Florida Seminole Indians.  At the same time, the US created Fort Brooke to oversee the reservation as well as protect the strategic harbor.  \n\nThe 1880s saw the town's first population boom.  In 1883, phosphate was discovered in the area, spurring the development of the mining and shipping industries in the area.  Shortly after, Henry B. Plant completed work on his railroad linking Tampa to Jacksonville.  He began promoting Tampa as a holiday spot and built the grand Plant Hotel as a luxury resort destination.  In 1886, Vicente Martinez Ybor opened Tampa's first cigar factory in Ybor City which encouraged the immigration of many Spanish, Cuban and Italian (primarily Sicilian) workers.\nDuring the Spanish American War at the turn of the century, Tampa was the main port of departure for troops heading for Cuba.  During this time, the Plant Hotel was converted into officer's accommodations, housing the Rough Riders and Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nIn more recent times, MacDill Air Force Base was created in 1939 and the University of South Florida in 1956.  Over the course of the Twentieth Century, Tampa has grown into the center of a large metropolitan area; it now hosts the regional headquarters of many international companies, has acquired numerous professional sports teams, and has even bid for the summer Olympics.  \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\n\nTampa is a very diverse city.  The first residents were the members of the Seminole Indian tribe that was relocated there from northern Florida and the soldiers stationed at Fort Brook to control the reservation.  The town remained a mostly military town until the 1880s when Tampa saw its first major waves of immigration from Cuba, Spain and Sicily. The major growth of the area did not occur until air conditioning became common in the years after World War II, but the region has been growing steadily since then.  Tampa is now home to many native Floridians, including Seminoles, Cubans, Spaniards and Italians, as well the residence of many 'transplants' from the Midwest and other areas of the states and new immigrants from the Caribbean and central America.  Tampa's population swells during the winter months with the arrival of the 'snowbirds,' retired persons from the northern U.S. and Canada who come down for a few months to enjoy the relative warmth.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Economy"]},"\n\nTampa has a growing economy and serves as a major port. Among others, Raymond James, Home Shopping Network, Outback Steakhouse, and a major portion of Citigroup are all headquartered in Tampa.  Tampa's major industries today are phosphate mining, shipping, citrus processing, shrimping, and tourism.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:TPA Airside C.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Airside C at Tampa International Airport."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tampaairport.com Tampa International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TPA"]]},"), , located near the waters of Tampa Bay along I-275.
