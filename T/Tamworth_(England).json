Birmingham New Street station is only one stop away with the service operated by Cross Country Trains.\n\nThe nearest airports are Birmingham International BHX (17 miles) and East Midlands EMA (27 miles). To reach Tamworth from Birmingham International head straight for the M42 Northbound and head north till Junction 10.
