Globalisation and tourism may have impact, but if you venture away from the tarmac roads you will find soon a way of life that may seem to a visitor as if it has not changed much in the last 100 years.\n\nTraditional Tongkonan houses stand proudly in this setting.  These intricately decorated houses with upward-sloping roofs are the centre of all Aluktodolo (Torajan religion before the coming of missionaries; the ancestors' belief) rites; from storing the harvest in the carved rice barns, \"alang\", to slaughtering sacred water buffaloes at funeral ceremonies that last a week or longer. Tana Toraja's beauty is also reflected in its people.  Although they are mostly devoutly Christian (there is a small number of Muslims especially in the southern area), they combine this religious belief with magic and mysticism, and welcome visitors to witness their ceremonies.\n\nTana Toraja is a sleepy rural region cultivating rice, cacao, coffee, and cloves most of the year.  Toraja's arabica coffee carries a high reputation and is something that visitors may be interested in trying.  During the dry season, from June until September, when children are home from school, the rice is harvested and it's time for a \"rambu solo'\", a complex funeral ceremony of the ancestors.

Frequent mikrolets\/bemos leave from Makassar to the bus terminal and take about 40 minutes. The bus from Makassar to Tana Torajo is very clean and comfortable. Please note however, that if you intend continuing further north, the buses are generally slower, in poorer condition and far less comfortable.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi or charted vehicle"]},"\nA chartered car usually costs about 850,000 - 1.200.000 Rupiah one-way from Makassar.  It is possible to find one for a few hundred thousand less if you can coordinate with someone who is driving in that direction.  If you plan on staying for a few days and would like the return trip as well, a driver with car should cost about 550,000 Rupiah per day.\n\nPlease beware that if you are planning to drive your own car, the stretch of road from Makassar, starting from Maros district area up to the town of Pare Pare is currently undergoing a road widening works. You may have to suddenly switch onto the opposite lane, because the lane you are on is blocked for the construction work. Be very careful and watch out for this kind of roadblock, because road signs indicating this is virtually non existent. This problem is made incredibly worse during night time by the absence of proper street light, so exercise extreme caution.\n\nThe road from the town of Enrekang to Makele (the town before Rantepao) is a stretch of unlit, small, winding, uphill road, accompanied with some fogging and drizzle at night. Along this road, you will frequently come across big buses going downhill from Makele. Gas station is few and far between, with intermittent local shops along the way.
