The temple is located on a rock just offshore. It is said to be the work of revered 15th century Hindu priest Nirartha and forms an important element of Balinese spirtualism and mythology.\n\nThis is an extremely popular tourist destination and the whole area is often very busy indeed, especially in the late afternoons, pre-sunset. The area between the car park (Rp 5,000 per vehicle) and the beach adjacent to the temple is a maze of souvenir shops selling just about every Balinese trinket imaginable.  \n\nOnce you have fought your way through the souvenir vendors to the beach, you will see the magnificent temple perched on a rock just a few metres offshore. There is a footpath to the raised cliff area just to the south from where the views of the temple and the sunset behind it are outstanding. Photo-opportunities abound. Entry fee is Rp 10,000.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Restoration of the Temple"]},". A comprehensive restoration programme started in the 1990s when it was realised that the rock was seriously eroded and in danger of collapse. This major work resulted in the actual temple being out of bounds which was still intermittently the case in early 2009.  This is not really a hindrance to visitors though as entrance to the actual temple is not the key attraction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nThe superb Nirwana ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nirwanabaligolf.com\/ Golf Course"]}]}," is adjacent to Tanah Lot, just to the south.
