It has many of the things that travellers love--a sense of exotic mystery, interesting history, beautiful vistas, unspoiled beaches, and friendly people.\n\nQuite appropriately, Tangier's the birthplace of Ibn Battuta, considered by many to be one of the greatest travellers of all time and on a level with the Venetian Marco Polo. This Berber visited most of the \"known\" world at that time including most African regions north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uganda"]]}," and Eurasia as far as China.\n\nTangier is an interesting mix of the cultures of north Africa, Spain, and France. It was under joint international control until as recently as 1956 and is separated from Spain only by the 20 miles of the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\nFrequent ferries make the short crossing from Europe each day, and many cruise ships sailing between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic often include Tangier as a port of call.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ferry"]},"\n\nRegarding the Crossing: is best to take the FRS ferry from Tarifa port.the first ferry departure from Tarifa-spain To Tangier-Morocco is at 9.00 AM and every 2 hours. from Tangier, the latest FRS ferry run back to Tarifa is at 22.00 PM. It is more convenient to take the ferry from Tarifa port in order to dock in Tangier port situated in the City. when you take the ferry from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Algeciras"]]}," you'll be arriving in Tangier new port(Tanger-Med) Situated in about 40 KM from Tangier(one hour each way from Tangier).\n\nNote that the ferry from Tarifa to Tangier is around 35 Euros, while the ferry from Algeciras to Tangier-Med is only around 20 Euros (appears to be cheaper if booked online). The bus from Tangier-Med to Tangier runs every hour and costs 25 Dh. There is also a train that runs four times a day. Prices correct as of 9. April 2014.\n\nThere's a 2nd company operating similar ferries from Tarifa - Tangier; their offices are right next to FRS's in the harbor.  They seem to offer similar services with slightly larger but less pretty boats, and with a slightly different schedule.  Their name is something generic.  \n\nFor those arriving by bus - there's a tour office on the main street behind the bus station selling commission-free tickets, though just buying on the spot in the port is just as viable.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nTangier-Ibn Batouta Airport (TNG) is located 12 km (7.5 miles) from the city (travel time about 20 minutes). Taxi 100 Dh (10€) from Tangier, 150 Dh (15€) at night or from the airport to Tangier Ville (to train station: 120 Dh).  At present Royal Air Maroc, easyJet, Ryanair, Iberia, Jet4you, Air Berlin, Corendon Airlines and Air Arabia Maroc fly here.  All persons entering or leaving Morocco are required to complete an entry\/exit card and non-residents are permitted to remain in Morocco for a total of 90 days.  \n\nComing in by plane is the easiest and hassle free way of coming to Tangier: there are no touts at the airport and the prices of the taxis are fixed by the government. Beware of long queues at passport controls before flights bound for the Schengen area.\n\nIf you’re on a shoestring and need to get to the airport, take a grand taxi to Assilah (20Dh) or Gueznaia and exit when the road goes off to the airport (it's signposted). It’s only a short walk from there (1.8km). Coming from the airport, a grand taxi running into Tanger can be easily caught at the crossing.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By rail"]},"\n\nONCF opened a new train station, Tanger Ville, in 2003, which is now the end of the line.  While it's closer to the city center than Tanger Morora, the original end-of-the-line, it's still quite a long walk so take a petit taxi for 15dhs or so.\n\nThe country has an excellent railway system with 1,893km (1,176mi) of track and a fine intercity passenger service. Overnight train services running throughout Europe can connect with Morocco.  Most of the time, non stop trains are fine but those which are not direct sometimes make unscheduled stops en route but do not panic as you will reach your destination eventually.\n\nThere is a night-train leaving from Tangier to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marrakesh"]]}," at 9:05PM costing 350 Dirhams for a couchette.  There is a daily train service to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fez"]]}," which takes around 5 hours (1st Class: 155Dh, 2nd Class: 105Dh).\n\nWhen travelling overnight by train, it is usually cheaper to buy a couchette ticket than a first class ticket.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Notice"]}," If you are taking the night train, and not using the sleeper cars, you will probably not get a good night sleep. This is due to the lights being on, movement of people in the train, and conductors checking you ticket numerous times. It is probably a good idea to travel with someone who'll present your tickets, put on eye covers and take a sleeping pill.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car or motorcycle"]},"\nWhen coming into Tangier by car, be careful of hustlers on motorbikes who will ride alongside you and attempt all manner of dodginess. \n\nYou can come by car by ferry from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Algeciras"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tarifa"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," or through the Spanish enclave of Ceuta (reached by ferry from Algeciras and ports in Spain).  The ferry crossing varies from 1 hour to 3 hours. Shortest and cheapest will be from Tarifa to\/from Tangier taking around 40 min. Tarifa is probably the most laid-back option as far as ports are concerned. \n\nComing by car or motorcycle can be a daunting process especially if you are new to Morocco.  You have to complete a temporary import form for the customs (\"Douane\" in French).  Sometimes this is done on the ferry (usually in the busy summer months) and at other times at arrival in Tangier.  Like at the airport all persons entering Morocco also have to complete an entry\/exit card. The Police and the Customs will both search your car - often not together so you need to be patient.  \n\nIn recent years, things have improved considerably for tourists and you are not likely to be bothered too much but you will have to go through all the formalities of bringing your car into Morocco like everyone else.  You can only bring your car in for 6 months in any one year.  You are not allowed to leave it in Morocco unless you are prepared to pay the tax for the car which can be up to three times the actual cost of the car.  This applies even if your car breaks, but if your car is written off, you will need to notify the customs authorities to avoid paying tax on a car as an import. There are strict regulations on bringing a car. For example, customs will not allow someone else to the leave the country with a car entered under someone else's name. Exceptions applied for relatives.\n\nYou must have \"green card\" insurance for your vehicle when driving\/riding in Morocco. You can get this insurance from many companies in Europe, or in Morocco at the port in Tangiers. If you are stopped, you must show this insurance to the police. (Police have had a recent directive not to hassle tourists, so you may not be stopped at all, but still you'd better have the insurance in the unlikely event of an accident.) If you do not have insurance from your home country, then local insurance can be purchased at small insurance booths situated at the port.  The insurance companies are reasonably reputable and will pay out if you have an accident.  Note that this insurance policy has limitations and you are likely to have much more comprehensive cover from insurers from your own country.  Most European insurers will cover Morocco and many include it under their standard level of European cover.\n\nContact details for Moroccan customs (Douane) are:\n:Administration des Douanes et Impôts Indirects, \n:Avenue Annakhil, Centre des Affaires, Hay Riad, Rabat\n:Tél : +212 (0)537717800\/01 - +212 (0)537579000\n:Fax : +212 (0)537717814\/15\n:Email : adii@douane.gov.ma\n: Web site: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.douane.gov.ma"]},"\n\nIt's recommended to contact the above authority, if needed, in either Arabic or French.\n\nMotorcyclists will benefit from the vast amount of information in the Morocco Knowledge base for BMW GS'ers in the UK.

(Note that Port of Tangier, and Port of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tanger Med"]]}," are different ports. Port of Tangier is normally served from Tarifa, Spain; and Tanger Med, the new commercial port, is served from Algeciras, Spain. Tanger Med is the French spelling, which is used in road signs and in GPS maps.) Although the government has been partially successful in reducing the number of touts, money changers, taxi drivers and ",{"type":"''","value":["faux guides"]}," hassling people arriving by boat, expect to be mobbed. Look like you know where you're going, politely refuse any offers of help or ignore the \"fake guides\" completely, or if you really feel like you need to escape jump in a taxi to escape the throng; just make sure that the taxi driver is no worse than the mob you are trying to escape.  The taxi rank is inside the port area - you are likely to be mobbed by requests from many drivers.  There is no queuing system - just take the taxi which you have agreed a fare with and are comfortable with.  The blue coloured petit taxis are substantially cheaper and used more by locals and are preferable to the cream coloured grande taxis who are mostly unmetered. The grande taxis generally also will still try and charge you more even if you have agreed price, be insistent and get all your change back. \n\nThere are many fast hydrofoils daily on FRS Ferry Serice ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.frs.es"]}," from Tarifa in Spain for about 37 Euros one way, or 67 Euros round-trip (as of November 2010). Several times a day there are also fast Balearia ferries ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.balearia.com"]}," from Algeciras, Spain to the new ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tangier-Med"]]}," Port (25 miles from downtown Tangier) for 29.50 Euros one-way or 62.50 Euros round-trip (as of November 2010). Passengers should be aware that the boats often run slower than the advertized time (because they depart later than scheduled time or simply take longer to get across).  So give yourself an ample time cushion (1 hour minimum) if you plan to catch another transportation after you get off the ferry.  For example, one speed catamaran between Tangier and Tarifa advertizes one hour travel time between Tanger and Algeciras on their brochure (35-minute boat travel between Tangier and Tarifa, then 15-minute bus travel from Tarifa to Algeciras), but in reality, this trip will take over 2 hours.  Example:  the boat frequently leave later (by 15-30 minutes) than the scheduled time, then once at Tarifa, the bus does not depart until everyone on the boat clears customs (which takes 30-45 minute), then the bus will take 20-25 minutes to travel from Tarifa to Algericas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Walking"]}," is perhaps the best way to see the relatively compact Tangier. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Petit taxis"]}," are common, but if it is unmetered make sure you agree on a price first.  Tangier is very easy to navigate around; the two main roads are Boulevard Mohamed V which runs from near the Medina through the ville nouvelle and Boulevard Mohamed VI (formerly Ave des FAR) which runs along from the beachfront from the port to Malabata.  The Medina area is a complex array of alleyways some of which can only be accessed on foot.  Mohamed V has a whole range of clothes shops, pharmacies and cafes as well as Hotel Flandria, Hotel Rembrandt.  Hotel Minzah lies just off this road.  Mohamed VI runs along the beach front where you will find numerous hotels (Rif, Ramada, Sherezade, Solazure, Tariq, Movenpick), bars, discos, restaurants and cafes.  Most hostels are situated on the roads heading uphill near the port area.\n\nMost locals in Tangier will be unfamiliar with what we call the \"ville nouvelle\".  To help with agreeing fares and generally with navigating using taxis  - the central main thoroughfare is simply known as the \"Boulevard\", the beach area as \"Playa\", the port as \"Marsa\", the medina as \"souk barra\", the hilly area to the west of Tangier with the Golf Course and Race Track as \"California\", the residential area heading towards the main road to Tetouan as \"Idrissia\", the thieves market as \"Casa Barata\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tangier_city_museum_enclave.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Tangier city museum"]]},"\nTake a simple walk along the beach (Ave Mohamed VI) to enjoy what the city is famed for.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kasbah"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Kasbah Museum"]},", the former Sultan's palace deserves to be seen not only for its collection of artefacts from the Phoenician to modern times, but also for the building and garden.

There are other markets notably the souk in the medina (mainly vegetables, clothes and tourist items) and in Ben Mekada (vegetables).

The only trouble you may encounter is the persistent touts whom you should ignore, or the con-men ready to fleece you, and you will encounter these almost exclusively in the medina. There are policemen everywhere and you will probably feel safer than at home.\n\nDressing like a local - as opposed to white shorts, shoes, and a backpack - will help you blend in and get good reception from merchants, who will often quote you actual prices instead of inflated tourist prices. There are lots of expats in this city that speaks Spanish first, then English and then French. A polite no thank you and then simply ignoring touts does get rid of them. \n\nIf you are lost in the medina, you can easily find your way out by going uphill (souk\/English church\/Nouvelle Village) or down (port). Kids and young men may ask you for money to lead you out (a couple of dirams), or to the Cafe Central, but if you are asked if you are lost and do not want help, say \"Yes, but happily,\" and usually that gets a laugh and solitude.\n\nTangier is a safe place for solo women travelers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Visit ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hercules Caves"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Grottes d'Hercules"]},"). The caves of Hercules, located 14 km west of Tangiers, are a place of stunning natural beauty and great archeological significance. Apparently, this is where the mythical figure, Hercules, used to rest after finishing his 12 labours. The cave also bears a mirror image resemblance to the continent of Africa. Get there by taxi costing about 10 dirham and takes about 15 minutes. It costs 10 dirham to get into the cave, do not bother with a tour guide."]},"\nYou can buy train, bus and ferry tickets at the stations and ports listed above, although you may find it easier to purchase ferry tickets from travel agents rather than face the gauntlet of touts at the port. If you plan on leaving by ferry, it is important to note that the ferries to Algeciras often do not follow a set schedule, and departure times can change even within a day of having purchased tickets.  One alternative is to take a fast ferry to Tarifa, because these are more likely to run on time and at least one of the companies provides a free bus to the port at Algeciras.  You can also flag ",{"type":"''","value":["grand taxis"]}," at the major bus stations and ferry port.\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Mediterranean Morocco"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["35.8000"],["-5.8333"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Tangier"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Tangier"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Africa\/Morocco\/Localities\/Tanger\/"]]}]
