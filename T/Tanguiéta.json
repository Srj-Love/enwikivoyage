The new Natitingou is Tanguiéta. With a more concise city center and a better small town feel, Tanguiéta is also a crossroads and an ideal place to stop and spend a night on your way to the gorgeous waterfalls in Tanangou (40 km on dirt road, a 3000F motorcycle ride), the National Park Pendjari (an additional 15km past Tanangou), the Saturday millet beer market in Tayacou (10 km, 1000F motorcycle ride on the Cobly road) or heading up to Burkina Faso.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\nFrom Cotonou, there are two bus services that leave at 7am and arrive in Tanguiéta around 4pm. This is your best bet. The companies are Confort Lines and Coton' Bus. Confort Lines has less leg room but gives you a free sandwich. Coton' Bus has more room, is an independent company and not a behemoth like Confort Lines and was also the first company to provide service to Tanguiéta. Both provide free bags of treated water. Your choice. There is also a return bus each day, again leaving Tanguita at 7am and arriving in Cotonou at 4pm.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nOne can walk most distances in town.
