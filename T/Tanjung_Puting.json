One reason for the relatively intact survival of this part of Kalimanatan is that the soils are relatively infertile for conventional agriculture with pH ranges of 3.8−7.0 and there are peat bogs of up to 3m in depth.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nMuch of this area was designated a game reserve in 1935 and this formed the nucleus of the land gazetted as a National Park in 1982.
