During this time of the year (November-March) the winds pack quite a punch, whipping up the seas to impressively-sized swell and beach surf, ideal for high-wind sailors and wave-surfers.\n\nDuring the milder Southwest monsoon (May-October), the area is somewhat shielded from the winds by the jutting capes, rendering the waters calmer and clear and thus more suitable for more recreational sailing, saiing classes, as well as kayaking, snorkeling, freediving, scuba diving, fishing, stand up paddling and island-hopping boat trips. \n\nThat said, outside the Tanjung Resang bay the winds at times can still good enough for high-speed windsurfing.\n\nTanjung Resang's pristine hinterland also lends itself for eco-tourism, off-roading and hiking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nLastly, while in Tanjung Resang, sample the kerupuk lekor, a local delicacy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Johor"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Tanjung Resang"]]}]
