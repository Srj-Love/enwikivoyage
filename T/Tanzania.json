More recently, Tanzania is believed to have been populated by hunter-gatherer communities, probably Cushitic and Khoisan speaking people. About 2000 years ago, Bantu-speaking people began to arrive from western Africa in a series of migrations. Later, Nilotic pastoralists arrived, and continued to immigrate into the area through to the 18th century.\n\nTravellers and merchants from the Persian Gulf and Western India have visited the East African coast since early in the first millennium CE. Islam was practised on the Swahili coast as early as the eighth or ninth century CE.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Imperial Germany conquered the regions that are now Tanzania (minus Zanzibar), Rwanda, and Burundi, and incorporated them into German East Africa. The post-World War I accords and the League of Nations charter designated the area a British Mandate, except for a small area in the northwest, which was ceded to Belgium and later became Rwanda and Burundi). British rule came to an end in 1961 after a relatively peaceful (compared with neighbouring Kenya, for instance) transition to independence. In 1954, Julius Nyerere transformed an organization into the politically oriented Tanganyika African National Union (TANU). Nyerere became Minister of British-administered Tanganyika in 1960 and continued as Prime Minister when Tanganyika became officially independent in 1961. After the Zanzibar Revolution overthrew the Arab dynasty in neighboring Zanzibar, which had become independent in 1963, the island merged with mainland Tanganyika to form the nation of Tanzania on 26 April 1964. \n\nFrom the late 1970s, Tanzania's economy took a turn for the worse. Tanzania also aligned with China, seeking Chinese aid. The Chinese were quick to comply, but with the condition that all projects be completed by imported Chinese labor. From the mid 1980s, the regime financed itself by borrowing from the International Monetary Fund and underwent some reforms. From the mid 1980s Tanzania's GDP per capita has grown and poverty has been reduced.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\n\nA large central plateau makes up most of the mainland, at between 900 m and 1800 m.

Head to Mbeya if you want to either visit Lake Tanganyika, enter into Malawi, or head north to Kigoma. North of Mbeya, the roads aren't sealed, so it will be a long and very unpleasant trip. If you want to see Lake Nyasa (a.k.a. Lake Malawi), take the bus to Songea. Although you are within a stone's throw of Mozambique, there are no official entry points into Mozambique.\n\nFinally, if you're headed south of Dar, then you'll take the B2. This is the main route to the Selous and the Rufiji River. Along the way, you can also stop in Kilwa, Lindi, and, finally, Mtwara. The road isn't sealed the whole way, so, again, bring on a cushion.\n\nOutside Dar, roads between other cities and villages are in very poor condition, although they are slowly being improved. For instance, traveling from Arusha to Dodoma is slow. It can be faster to return to Chalinze and then board a bus to Dodoma. This is pretty much the case for any travel between cities that are not located along the road to Dar.\n\nThe border town of Namanga is a hectic outpost that epitomizes much of Africa. The bus even waits here for you to cross the border. You can even get off on the Kenyan side, walk across the border, and get on the bus again on the Tanzanian side.\n\nFrom Dar by bus it is also possible to travel to Malawi, Uganda, and Rwanda.\n\nUseful information on the Dar es Salaam bus stand (\"Ubungo\") and some specific bus lines can be found in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dar_es_Salaam"]]}," article.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Bus Lines"]},"\n\nSee specific cities for more information about the bus lines that serve them.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Scandinavia Express"]}," connect Dar with Arusha \/ Moshi \/ Nairobi etc"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tahmeed Buses"]}," connect ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mombasa"]]}," with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tanga"]]}," and Dar in Tanzania."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Royal Coach"]}," travels to Arusha, and is one of the nicest buses available."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dar Express"]}," services many cities, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nairobi"]]},", Kenya."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sumry"]}," connect the beautiful southern part of Tanzania, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iringa"]]}," and Mbeya to Dar and further S.W."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nAzam Marine and Fast Ferries connect Dar es salaam and Zanzibar.

Most buses have a simple design, and the roads are poor, although 1st class air-con buses are available on the Dar-Moshi-Arusha route (Dar Express - ticket office on Libya Street downtown or office no. 45 at Ubungo). Nearly all buses go in and out of Dar es Salaam. The main bus station in Dar (where all buses go), Ubungo, is 8 km west of the city center. A number of the better \"intercity buses\" provide you with complimentary drinks and biscuits. \nIn Dar, minibuses called Dala-Dalas can be taken cheaply to most places within the city. The fare is written on the front next to the door - currently it's usually TSH 250 for adults (2011) except for longer distances. The route of the bus is also stenciled on the front and sides of the bus, e.g. 'Posta-Mwenge' and there's a colour coding system. Posta (outside the central post office on Azikiwe\/Maktaba Street) is the main downtown daladala hub. Others are Kariakoo, Mwenge, Buguruni, Ubungo etc. Hop on the daladala, take a seat if there is one, and pay the conductor ('konda') when he shakes his pile of coins at you in a meaningful way. The konda shouts the names of the stops - if you don't know where you are, or don't know the name of your destination stop, it'll be hard to know where to get off. If possible, it's worth asking someone at your destination, since the stops sometimes have no signs at all - people 'just know' that certain street corners are the daladala stop and the names are not obvious (e.g. 'Sudani' on the Masaki-Posta line - near the Sudanese ambassador's residence on Toure Drive). When you hear\/see your stop and want to get off, shout 'Shusha!' (let me off), the konda will knock on the chassis twice, and the driver will immediately swerve to the side and stop. The daladalas don't run very late; on the east side of town the latest ones are the Msasani and Mwenge routes. \n\nThere are also three-wheeled tuktuks\/baby taxis\/CNGs\/bajajis that zoom around. They are cheaper than a taxi, and can get past traffic jams. Probably not the safest option but I haven't heard of any bajaji-related problems. You can negotiate the fare in advance, but sometimes the driver doesn't know your destination 8there's no Dar es Salaam 'knowledge') and won't know how much to charge. The drivers I've taken have generally quoted pretty fair prices (maybe with a reasonable 'skin tax' for white people) at the destination and if they're trying to rip you off you can usually tell by the leer. It may be handy to know 'right' and 'left' in Swahili: kulia (right), kushoto (left), moja kwa moja (straight), simama (stop), asante kaka (thanks brother). \n\nPrivate ",{"type":"'''","value":["taxis"]}," are also a convenient choice, but be sure to negotiate the price before you use them.  Fellow travelers might be able to offer advice about a reasonable fare.  Some places (e.g. Dar es Salaam Airport) have a strong taxi cartel and post fixed prices.\n\nIf you can afford it, flying around Tanzania is faster and safer. See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tanzania#By_plane"]]}," section above. Even the busiest roads are in poor condition, and bus drivers are not known for their patience or great driving skills. Road accidents claim more lives in Tanzania than any other cause of death.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Car hire - rent a car for private use."]},"\n\nCar hire in Tanzania is affordable and there are many reliable 4WD jeeps like Landcruisers and Landrovers available for hire. 4WD cars are comfortable and can withstand all weather road conditions in Tanzania.

Tanzania is home to several national parks and game reserves. Safaris in Tanzania can be put into two categories, the Northern Circuit (Serengeti, Ngorongoro, Manyara and Tarangire) and the Southern Circuit (Selous, Mikumi and Ruaha). This is certainly an oversimplification and does not include other interesting but harder to reach parks such as Katavi and Gombe, just to name two. For tourist, the two first groupings are more accessible as several tour companies offer a variety a packages for these.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Price"]},"\n\nThe cost of a safari can range from the basics (fly-tents, self-catering and guides with vehicles) to smaller parks like Manyara and Tarangire, to luxury lodges and tented camps in the Serengeti which can cost anywhere from US$250 to US$1,500 per person per night. You can use your own vehicle, provided it's a 4x4 with adequate clearance. There is a benefit to hiring a guide and a vehicle as safari vehicles are equipped with open rooftops which provide a much better vantage point for animal viewing. Also, many park will require that you hire a certified guide before you enter the park, even if you're using your own vehicle. Guides can cost around US$35 a day plus tip. Guides are good to have since they know the park and can help you locate some of the more sought after animals such as lions, leopards, rhinos, cheetahs and hyenas.\n\nPark fees for Manyara and Tarangire are as of July 2008 US$35 per person and US$10,- for vehicle\/driver fees. For Ngorongoro there is a US$200 vehicle fee as well, a $50 per person park fee as well as a $10,- vehicle\/driver fee. For the Serengeti it's US$100 per person with and a $10,- vehicle\/driver fee. These fees are valid for 24 hours. If you arrive in the afternoon, you can return in the morning the next day and not pay again.\n\nSome of the more popular safari companies are Warrior Trails, Ranger tours & Leopard tours. Other popular companies rated by the Tanzania Association of Tour Operators include Ajabu Adventures, Bush2Beach Safaris, Bushmen Expeditions, Fay Safaris and Tanzania Tour Company.  Serena and Sopa are popular lodging spots and have facilities throughout the Northern Circuit. However, don't discount using smaller tours and lesser known lodging facilities which are just as good if not better than the larger tours and lodges.\n\nFor better prices and some of the most beautiful parks avoiding the traffic jams of safari vehicles, head for the southern circuit, particularly Ruaha National Park where fees are still only $20 per person and the range of wildlife is much greater and the scenery spectacular.

Park fees are $50\/person\/day as of July 2008, and a guide with a 4-wheel drive vehicle is required.

Additionally, Selous is the only other place besides Ngorongoro where you may see a rhino. You can also visit the Uduzungwa Mountains Park for a truly wilderness hike through unspoiled and spectacular scenery. There are few places left in the world like this one.

If, in spite of your best efforts, you do contract malaria, it is usually easily treated with medication that is readily available throughout most of the country. If you plan on being in isolated locations, you may wish to drop by a clinic and purchase a batch. Note that symptoms associated with malaria can take up to two weeks before manifesting themselves. The rule of thumb for ex-pats living in Tanzania is this: Any fever lasting more than a day should be cause for concern and necessitate a trip to the clinic for a malaria test.

The usual response from an elder will be 'marahaba'. In Zanzibar, the equivalent of 'shikamoo' is 'chei chei'. The traveler will get along very well when using these verbal expressions of respect. In addition, a title after the 'shikamoo' is also a useful indicator that you are not just a dumb tourist -- 'shikamoo bwana' for the gents, and, when addressing a female elder, 'shikamoo mama'.\n\nTanzanians will also comment if you are doing any work while they are not, with the phrase \"pole na kazi\". It literally means \"I'm sorry you have to work\". A simple \"asante\", or \"thanks\", will suffice in reply.\n\nMany Tanzanian sellers are persistent and, ordinarily, a simple head shake, accompanied by \"asante sana\", should settle it. However, as a last resort, a firm \"hapana\", meaning \"no\", will do the trick. Tanzanians find the word \"hapana\" quite rude, so please don't use it casually -- only as a last resort.
