All schools and most businesses are closed for the duration. There's also an increased media presence, and anthropologists come to document it as well. Also, many Taramans who are now living off-island return for this festival. The island is basically stretched to its seams for the festival. If you're not interested in the festival, you'll probably want to make sure you're not on Tarama during it. Although there's a lot of drinking, things stay relatively calm, or at least as calm as a festival of this magnitude could ever be."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Tarama Village Ethnographic Learning Center (多良間村ふるさと民俗学習館 Tarama-son furusato minzoku gakushukan).

Because Tarama is very, very, very flat, the highest point is not a geological feature such as a hill or a mountain, but rather a 33m-high structure on a small hill. It's named \"Yaeyama Toomidai\" because, on a clear day, if you look west from the tower, you can see clearly the Ishigaki island, the nearest part of the Yaeyama Islands, (\"Toomidai\" means that it allows you to see way out into the distance beyond the foest). You can also see all of Tarama (Tarama island and Min-na island). You might see Miyako, but other than that you probably won't see much more than open water. Obviously, there aren't any obstructions, so you can see as far as the current visibility conditions permit, in all directions."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Hometown Beach Park (ふるさと海浜公園).Local name is \"Nagashak\".It has nice beach and shower.
