It is a major Hindu pilgrimage centre and several thousand devotees visit the temple every day. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]}," \nAccording to Hindu belief, an insulted Sati, the wife of Lord Shiva, sacrificed herself at a yagna (fire worship ritual) which was being performed by her father Dakshmaharaj. Angry with this incident Lord Shiva started the Tandava Nritya (Dance of Destruction). In order to prevent destruction of  all creation, Lord Vishnu used his Sudershan charka (wheel)  to cut the body of Sati into several parts. Sati's body was scattered all over what is presently the Indian subcontinent. There are 51 such holy spots where temples have been erected and they are called Pithas or the Shakti Pithas. Some of the Pithas are in West Bengal. The most popular of them are Kalighat (in Kolkata}, Bakreshwar and Tarapith. \nIt is believed that the eyeball of Sati fell down at Tarapith. In Bengali, the eye ball is called 'Tara' and that is why the name of the village was changed from the earlier Chandipur to Tarapith. \n\nIt is said that in ancient times Saint Bashistha attained his divinity by meditation under a Simul tree on the bank of river Dwaraka. He attained his divinity by worshipping the Goddess Sati or Tara (in the form of Kali)and sitting on tha panch mundi ashan or the sitting place surrounded by 5 skulls of different animals,like human,owl,elephant,black snake and monkey. That Simul tree is no more there and  river Dwaraka has moved away. Subsequently a number of saints like Saint Bamakshyapa (19th century devotee) and Kamalakanta (18th century devotee, who composed many songs, still sung) came here to worship the Goddess for their spiritual salvation. \n\nThe old temple of Goddess Tara is somewhat damaged. The present temple with eight roofs was built in 1225 by one Jagannath Ray of Mallarpur village. On the main gate of the temple the statue of Goddess Durga and her full family are carved. On the left the war of Kurukshetra (Mahabharata) and on the right stories from Ramayana are depicted.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tara Behala.JPG"],["thumb"],["A Replica of the Tarapith Temple Tara at a Kali Puja Pandal"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" By road - One has to travel along the Panagarh Morgram expressway.
