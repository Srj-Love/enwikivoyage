Bordered by the cities of Morales (on the West) and Banda de Shilcayo (on the East) Tarapoto is the commercial center of the District and one of the larger metropolitan centers in the Amazon Rainforest.\n\nWhile Tarapoto is sometimes overlooked by tourists heading to Iquitos, visitors will find that because of its cloud forest location at an altitude over 350 meters, the temperatures won't get as hot, usually not above 95 degrees Fahrenheit, and perhaps more importantly, the humidity is not generally as high as the low jungle.  Many day trips within a half-hour to a two-hour drive from Tarapoto include some of the most spectacular natural beauty anywhere, historic wonders, and some of the places have cooler weather than in the city.  There are scenic outlooks, waterfalls, lakes, rivers, fauna and flora of all sorts, and some of the most interesting people in the world live in this area.\n\nTarapoto has many restaurants, hotels, Internet cafes, markets, and other attractions that would interest tourists from all walks of life.  With a rich cultural heritage and many historic landmarks nearby, it is a great place for people who want something more than just a hammock and a tropical drink -- although the latter can be found readily as well.  Few businesses have air conditioning.  There are several hotels that have air conditioning, but many do not so it is important to ask.\n\nAnother thing travelers should be sure to ask about before checking into a hotel -- unless they don't mind a cold shower -- is if the room has hot water; many do not.  In most neighborhoods, there is no running water during the early afternoon and early morning, so it is also wise to ask about the hours of availability of water -- although many hotels and restaurants have their own holding tanks for water which makes it no problem.\n\nOne of the things that makes Tarapoto attractive to travelers who have discovered this city is the fact that it is a great central location in the northern part of Peru.  The mountains (high sierra) to the west, and the jungle (selva) to the east, make Tarapoto a good place to call home-base when visiting northern Peru.  A modern airport makes travel to the major cities fairly easy, if only somewhat dependable, with daily flights to and from Lima.\n\nIn many ways, Tarapoto still has a \"small town\" atmosphere.  While it is always necessary to keep alert when traveling anywhere, Tarapoto is a place one can relax more.  Europeans and North Americans are not targets of crime as much as in the other places like Trujillo, Cusco, and Lima.  Since there aren't as many tourists around Tarapoto, the locals don't see too many foreigners.  So expect to be noticed if you don't look like a Peruvian, but tourists generally find themselves treated very well in Tarapoto.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Tarapoto has an airport, which can be flown to directly from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lima"]]},".

Automobile taxis are also available in lesser numbers.  Whether using a taxi or mototaxi, tourists should always negotiate the price of the trip before getting into the vehicle, or they might find themselves paying far more than necessary for the ride.  Mototaxi drivers are sometimes reckless, so tourists should not hesitate to tell the driver to slow down if necessary.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Cataratas de Ahuashiyacu"]},"Not really worth the money (the taxi, not the 3 sol entrance fee).

The owners, Cesar and Stephanie are very welcoming. They are biologists and know very well the local flora and fauna, they can show you butterflies, birds, frogs, medicinal plants, natives fruits, etc. Very nice walks are available in the surroundings to go deeper in the forest or to reach waterfalls nicer than the ones you can access from the road.To get there, it is better to contact them first so that they can organise your stay or carry your staff for the night on moto.
