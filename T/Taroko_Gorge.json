In a single afternoon you can travel from rugged coastal cliffs through a maze of subtropical forested canyons to high elevation subalpine coniferous forests.\n\nIn about 60 kilometers the landscape rises from sea level to some of the tallest peaks in Taiwan at over 3400 meters. That's steep!\n\nThe force behind the steep valleys and narrow canyons is a (geologically speaking) relatively fast rate of uplift combined with ample water.  Over the last 70 million years, these two forces collaborated to form the world's deepest marble canyon.  The slot canyons here are remarkable with narrows sections a thousand feet high and only a dozen yards apart, reminiscent of the Virgin River in Zion National Park in Utah, USA. Ignore the fact that Zion is in the desert, and made of sandstone and Taroko is subtropical and comprised of marble, and these two gorges have a lot in common.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThe park has 144 species of birds 10 percent of which are indigenous to Taiwan. It also hosts over 30 large species of mammal including deer, boar, and bear.  251 species of butterflies, 32 species of reptile and 18 species of fish are also known but considering the rugged terrain of the park, this is probably only a fraction of the species that actually live in the park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe climate is subtropical and generally mild.  Rainfall is abundant year round so be prepared and be especially cautious about entering the gorge during typhoons or periods of extended heavy rain due to the danger of landslides and rockfall.\n\nAccording the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau, average temperatures at low elevations in the park range from 14 degrees Celsius in January to 27 degrees Celsius in July. At higher elevation it is much cooler with winter temperatures at 2000 meters being about 5.5 degrees C in the winter and 17.5 degrees in the summer and at 3400 meters at the top of Hehuan, temperatures average -3 in January and 9 in July.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe nearest major city is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hualien"]]},". Flights and trains are available from Taipei and most major cities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hualien"]]},", bus departs from the train station at 6.30am (to Luoshao), 8.40am (to Lishan), 10.50am (to Tiansiang) and 1.50pm (to Tiansiang). After that, no bus is running anymore. All buses stop at Tzuchi Vihara, Sincheng Taroko Station (太魯閣火車站), Taroko Visitor Center (park entrance), Shakadang (砂卡礑) and Buluowan (布落灣）. Although the distance is not large, this bus should take at least 2 hours to Tiansiang, due to very frequent stops and reduced speed inside the gorge. Price: about 170NTD. No change is given, so be sure to bring the exact amount.\n\nThe Taiwan Tourism Office runs a Tour Taiwan (台灣好行) Taroko Bus departing from Hualien TRA station. There is a clearly signposted bus stop to the right as you exit the TRA station (in front of the tourist center), but you're better off getting on at the bus stop to the left of the TRA station, because the bus first stops there and tends to fill up quite quickly. The ticket office is also there. It stops at Qixintan Beach, Xincheng Railway Station, Taroko Archway, Taroko National Park HQ & Visitor Center (太管處), Changchun Shrine, Yanzikou (Swallow Grotto, 燕子口), Jiuqudong (Tunnel of Nine Turns, 九曲洞), Lushui (合流.綠水), Tianxiang (天祥) and then back along the a similar, but not absolutely identical route. The buses leave from Hualien at 07:50, 9:00, 10:20, 11:30, 12:30, 14:00 and 15:00 daily - it's about 40 minutes to the Park HQ, the full loop about 2.5 hours. Buses from the Park HQ to Hualien leave at 10:10, 11:10, 12:30, 13:30, 15:00, 16:00 and 17:30.\n\nOne-way tickets from Hualien to the Visitor Center are 92 NT$ and can be bought from the counter. Tickets for taking the same bus within the gorge, or for returning, can be bought directly from the driver (exact change is recommended). You can also buy a day or two-day pass from the ticket counter in Hualien which can be very good deals.\n\nMake sure you are standing on the right side of the road and hail at the bus if you wish to get on.\n\nThe Visitor Center offers free maps of the area. They can also provide you with up-to-date information on which trails are closed, as the weather and earthquakes may make them unsafe.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nA journey by train from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taipei"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hualien"]]}," takes 2 hours by express train (440NTD) and 3 to 4 hours by local trains. The trains are cheap, reliable and comfortable.  Station names are announced in English and Chinese so you should have no problem identifying your stop. \nThe closest train station to the park entrance is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sincheng"]}," (新城). From there, there is the choice of a one way taxi ride from the station to Taroko for about NT$200 or a day tour costing about NT$2,000.\n\nThe Tour Taiwan (台灣好行) Taroko Bus picks up and drops off at both Singcheng (新城) station and Hualien station.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nA taxi from the Hualien train station to Tiansiang (town in Taroko National Park, where the Grand Formosa hotel is located) costs about NT$1200 and takes about 1 hour.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By scooter"]},"\nYou can rent a scooter near the train station in Hualien. It takes around 30min to reach Taroko Gorge.  However in some cases you may need a local drivers license to do so.\nYou can also rent a scooter by the Xincheng train station, which is closer to the park. The price quoted in April 2012 was NT$500 per day. An American or European drivers license (and possibly other countries as well) and a passport will suffice at this shop.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nEntry to the park is free but if you want to go to some of the wilderness or into areas designated as Eco-protection areas or restricted mountain areas, you will need an entry permit. Be sure to apply for the permits early (at least 1 week before) as some permits are limited by a small number per day. Refer to the official Taroko National Park information website for application procedures: http:\/\/www.taroko.gov.tw\/English\/\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are numerous bus tours visiting the gorge every weekend. And, while the buses are comfortable and air-conditioned, the tours tend to have a tight itinerary (including, of course, the obligatory stop at some local gift shop), leaving little time for extended hiking. Tour buses leave from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hualien"]]}," visitor information center and cost about NT$988 per person for a whole day tour.\n\nThere is also a non-tourist bus that brings passengers to and from Tiansiang. However, it goes pretty fast around some sharp turns along steep cliffs. If you get car sick easily or are afraid of heights, you might want to pass on this bus.\nFrom Tiansiang, buses depart to inside the gorge at 8am to LuoShao (洛韶) and 10.05 to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["LiShan"]]}," (梨山). Starting from Tiansiang (169.5 km of highway 8; altitude: 480m), the bus to Lishan runs through Wenshan (167 km, 575m), Huitouwan (163.4 km, 750m), Xibao (161.4 km, 915m), Luoshao (洛韶, 154 km, 1117m), Xinbaiyang (143 km, 1644m), Ci'en (132.8 km, 1995m), Bilü Sacred Tree (128.3 km, 2150m), Guanyuan (117.3 km, 2374m), Dayuling (112.5 km, 2565m), Lishan (1800m).

Price: about 170NTD.\nDon't forget to bring enough coins as no change is given.\n\nThere is (or has been?) also a free shuttle bus which you can take from outside the Visitors Centre near the Train station. This runs all the way to Tiansiang and you can get off and on at about 10 stops. The timetable is available from the Visitor's Centre. It runs approximately every hour from about 8:00 to 17:00 [though not on the hour]. There are a few extra services at weekends.

However, it's a fantastic place to ride for those with experience. Scooters are available to rent in Hualien. If you run low on fuel, the locals often stock a small supply that they'll part with for a miraculously uninflated price.  There is also a gas station 50 km passed Taroko on the number 8 road (around kilometer 118). The drive there climbs to an impressive 3 km altitude. Bring warmer clothes and rain gear. Also make sure to get a helmet with a rain visor. \nYou can rent a scooter from Pony near the train station in Hualien (around NT$400\/day)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nFor the truly adventurous, cycling is a wonderful way to traverse the park.You can rent a bike just in front of the entrance of the Taroko national park.
