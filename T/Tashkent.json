The city has a mixture of modern new office buildings, hotels, parks, and crumbling Soviet-style apartment blocks. The streets are generally clean and there are not too many potholes in the city centre. Further out, the infrastructure is not so good.\n\nOver the last few years the Uzbek government has embarked on a major reconstruction program in the centre of the city. Roads, government buildings and parks are all being reconstructed (many historical buildings and sites are bulldozed in process). To the visitor, the new city looks very impressive, although many of the local residents have yet to see any improvement in their residential areas.\n\nTashkent is waiting for a boom. The infrastructure, hotels, and shops are there but the influx of people and business has failed to materialise. This is caused in part by a combination of government policy and bad publicity.\n\nTashkent has a population of 2.3 million people (2012).\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = 6"],["febhigh = 8"],["marhigh = 14"],["aprhigh = 22"],["mayhigh = 27"],["junhigh = 33"],["julhigh = 36"],["aughigh = 34"],["sephigh = 29"],["octhigh = 21"],["novhigh = 14"],["dechigh = 9"],["janlow = -3"],["feblow = -2"],["marlow = 4"],["aprlow = 10"],["maylow = 14"],["junlow = 18"],["jullow = 19"],["auglow = 17"],["seplow = 12"],["octlow = 7"],["novlow = 3"],["declow = -1"],["janprecip = 55"],["febprecip = 47"],["marprecip = 72"],["aprprecip = 64"],["mayprecip = 32"],["junprecip = 7"],["julprecip = 4"],["augprecip = 2"],["sepprecip = 5"],["octprecip = 34"],["novprecip = 45"],["decprecip = 53"],["jansun = 9"],["febsun = 10"],["marsun = 11"],["aprsun = 13"],["maysun = 14"],["junsun = 15"],["julsun = 15"],["augsun = 14"],["sepsun = 13"],["octsun = 11"],["novsun = 10"],["decsun = 9"],["janh2o ="],["febh2o ="],["marh2o ="],["aprh2o ="],["mayh2o ="],["junh2o ="],["julh2o ="],["augh2o ="],["seph2o ="],["octh2o ="],["novh2o ="],["dech2o ="],["description = ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tashkent"]}," has a typical continental climate with hot summers and cold winters.

Most businesses use Russian in their signs, menus, and other printed material. Only government institutions use Uzbek as the first language, and even then, many government forms and reports are in Russian, rather than Uzbek. Currently, Uzbek uses the Latin alphabet rather than the Cyrillic that was used during the Soviet Union. This is a source of some confusion for many Uzbeks, especially those of the older generation. Shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union and Uzbekistan declared independence in 1991, the written Uzbek language was converted back into Latin characters. Many older Uzbeks have difficulty reading the Latin characters. Uzbek is a Turkic-based language, and while Uzbeks and Turks cannot completely communicate directly, the better educated on both sides can usually find some common understanding.\n\nMany of the signs in Tashkent are in Cyrillic. A significant number of Russian words are similar to their English counterparts. Learning the Cyrillic alphabet, not as difficult as one might think, will help a traveller to read signs and in restaurants. It is very useful for the casual visitor to Tashkent to learn a few basic Russian or Uzbek words and phrases. If you need to speak English, young people are your best bet, and even then there is no guarantee that they will speak more than basic English.\n\nThe name Tashkent is usually attributed to the Turkish words \"tash\" (\"stone\") and the Persian word \"kent\" (\"city\"), meaning \"city of stones\". Another opinion refers to the Sogdian word \"tschatsch\", meaning \"place on a hill\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tashkent International Airport"],["alt=Yuzhniy (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TAS"]]},")"],["url=http:\/\/uzairways.com\/airports.aspx"],["email="],["address="],["lat=41.2624"],["long=69.2664"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=is just a few kilometres from the city centre."]]}]},"\nAirlines include:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/wwww.aeroflot.ru\/templates\/index_en\/ Aeroflot"]}," - Daily flights to Moscow and from there to the rest of the world"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.turkishairlines.com\/en-uk\/ Turkish Airlines"]}," Daily flights to Istanbul and from there to the rest of the world"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/airbaltic.com\/public\/index.html Air Baltic"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/csa.cz\/en\/portal\/homepage\/cz_homepage.htm Czech Airlines"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/iranair.com\/ Iran Air"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/koreanair.com\/ Korean Air"]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/uzairways.com\/airports.aspx Uzbekistan Airways"]}]},"\nThe airport has two terminals, domestic (Terminal 3) and international (Terminal 2) on opposite sides of the airfield. The only way to get from one to the other is by road, a 10-minute taxi ride.\n\nBefore passing through customs, you will need to fill out 2 copies of the customs declaration. These forms are often handed out on the flight or can be found on the stands in the baggage claim area. The customs officers will keep one copy and stamp the other. You will need this form when you leave the country and may have problem in taking out money without it. Make sure to declare all money and valuables (cameras, PCs etc.). You may not be able to leave with more money or valuable items than you arrive with. The Uzbek government have strict rules on entering or leaving with money. Don't be intimidated when you see a crowd running to a passport control officer. They are just trying to get a better spot in a huge waiting line.\n\nThe departure area is on the upper floor. The access road has been closed, so you have to walk around the left side of the arrivals level and up some stairs or up the road. Allow plenty of time when leaving the country via Tashkent airport. Check-in, customs, and passport control can be very time consuming, especially if there are large numbers of passengers. Make sure and have the customs form you were given when you entered the country.\n\nA short and inexpensive (USD2–3) taxi journey is the easiest way to get to the centre. One should bear in mind, however, that upon exiting the international terminal, a large number of men will be crowded at the (sole) exit door offering \"taxi\" services. For the most part, these are not \"official\" taxis. \"Taxi\" drivers will attempt to charge whatever they believe the market will bear. For those without Russian or Uzbek language skills it is best to arrange to have someone meet you at the airport. Fair fares are usually only obtainable by those who understand the system and speak at least some Russian or Uzbek. It is better to walk 50m from the exit towards the taxi stand where many taxis are waiting on the road and negotiate. Generally prevailing fare is minimum USD2-3 for 5km (20 cents per each additional km). Always negotiate. Taxi drivers will rarely accept small bills (dollars, euros, or pounds), and cannot be counted upon to give change (in any currency).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Railway Station"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=1 Turkestany St"],["lat=41.2909"],["long=69.2874"],["directions="],["phone=Information, 005; tickets, +998 29 97627"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Domestic"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Train 2 leaves Tashkent on M, Tu, F, Sa, and Su at 07:00 and arrives at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samarkand"]]}," at 10:50.

While there are official, authorized taxis (with the appropriate sign on the roof of the car), in reality almost any driver in Tashkent can double as a taxi driver. The local custom is to simply stand by the side of the road with your arm extended downward and slightly away from the body. A driver will pull over and then you will state your destination and negotiate the fare in advance. At least some Russian or Uzbek language skills are needed to accomplish this without difficulty. It is usually safe to use this procedure, although virtually every foreign embassy recommends against it. Directions are rarely given here using an address. Most often, a landmark is used, such as \"near Hotel Russia\". Moreover, many streets and hotels have been renamed in the past few years and often drivers will not recognize the current name of the street or hotel, still knowing them by their old names. Asking to be taken to the Grand Mir Hotel, for instance, will often result in a blank look. Tell the driver you want to go to the Gastinitsa Rossiya (Hotel Russia), however, and they will know exactly where you want to go. For those who speak neither Russian nor Uzbek, it is helpful to have someone draw a rudimentary map or write out directions in Russian. Few drivers will know English.\n\nDo not expect Western-style taxi services. Taxi drivers will often smoke while you are in the car and asking them not to will most often result in nothing more than a look of disapproval. You may be paying, but you are in their car.

Travellers should use the same caution they would use in any large city, especially at night.  It is not advisable for foreigners to walk around alone at night, especially in areas where few people are about and\/or lighting is poor. Police sometimes levy small on-the-spot fines for minor offences such as appearing to be slightly intoxicated.\n\nAvoid confrontations of any kind.  If you witness a confrontation, especially in a crowded area such as a bazaar, move away.\n\nConcerning food: in hot summer days try to avoid dairy products, mushrooms or any products that might be damaged by heat. You might want to avoid fish unless you are sure it has been well stored.\n\nSome harassment by the wandering Gypsy population is possible but a donation of a few som or bottled water will generally satisfy them.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\nThe local currency is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Uzbek Sum"]},".

It is illegal to change currency on the black market, although the exchange rate can be up to 30% higher than in banks. If you do decide to exchange on the black market (only US$ or Euros), around Chorsu bazaar is the place. Some hotels will exchange money on the side at the better rate. US dollars can fetch a good rate but other acceptable currencies are Euros, British pounds, Russian rubles or Japanese Yen. Notes must be in perfect condition with no marks or damage. As of 2012, the official exchange rate is about 1900SUM to US$1 while the black market rate is about 2700sum to US$1. Few ATM's (known as Bankomat) work with foreign cards.  US dollars are available inside banks using international credit cards with commission of about 2%. The dollars can then be changed to local currency.
