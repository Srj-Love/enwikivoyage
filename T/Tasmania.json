A number of boutique beer makers and distillers are spread around the state.\n\nYou can tour the Tasmanian Wine Routes easily by car or on guided tours. The island's Wine Routes include the Tamar Valley, north of Launceston along both sides of the Tamar River and east to Pipers River; the Derwent, Coal River and Huon Valleys (together comprising the Southern Wine Route), an easy drive from Hobart; and the growing wine regions of the North West and the East Coast.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere is a variety of accommodation options available across the state, from camping through to 5-star luxury.

They are usually very willing to help you out or give advice when asked.\n\nJokes are occasionally made at the expense of Tasmanians by mainlanders about being inbred or have two heads. This is highly offensive. While this joke may slide in other parts of Australia it will not go down well here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["While driving"]},"\nWhen driving observe the speed limits. The rules are simple. 50km\/h on all Tasmanian streets, and 100km\/h on highways and country roads unless otherwise signposted. Many of Tasmania's country roads are narrow and windy, use common sense and drive to the conditions - not the speed limit.\n\nAlways slow down at school zones and crossings when in operation or you may be surprised by a waiting police car and receive a fine.\n\nBe especially careful driving between dusk and dawn as this is when the wildlife is most active. Be prepared to see a lot of roadkill. Wallabies and wombats can make a mess of your vehicle if hit. Drivers swerving to avoid wildlife have caused many accidents.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["In the bush"]},"\nBushwalking can be a truly breathtaking experience in Tasmania, but be sure to obtain the right gear, local advice and maps. Always sign the logbook at the beginning and end of each walk. Be aware that mobile coverage is limited in wilderness areas. The main dangers of bushwalking are getting lost and\/or suffering from hypothermia. Tasmania's weather is notoriously changeable. Be sure to take a good raincoat and warm clothes with you even on a sunny day because an hour or two later it could be pouring with rain. If undertaking more serious bushwalking a map and compass is a must, as is a good sleeping bag and tent for multi-day walks.\n\nThere are three species of snake in Tasmania: copperhead, white-lipped, and tiger. The tiger snake is one of the most venomous snakes in the world, but don't let that deter you. No one has died in Tasmania by snake bite since 1977, almost 40 years ago! All three use the same anti-venom so identification of the snake if bitten is not important. Most snakes will slither away as soon as they here you coming.\n\nWhile in wilderness areas the water may be good to drink, but it is still highly recommended that you boil before consumption. If in touristy areas, such as The Overland Track, always boil your water.\n\nMosquitoes are present all year round. There are no mosquitoes-born viruses. A good repellent is advisable if going into the bush.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hobart"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melbourne"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canberra"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brisbane"]]},", and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gold Coast"]]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Launceston"]]}," to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burnie"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Devonport"]]}," to Melbourne."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ferry"]},"\nThe Spirit Of Tasmania ferry service between Devonport and Melbourne departs 1-2 times a day.
