Over the years, more than 15000 petroglyphs and paintings were identified, as well as a great number of archeological remains. With numerous stone tools and artifacts, ceramics, burial mounds, enclosures and general habitational remains, Tassili n'Ajjer has provided archeologists with a wealth of information about life in the region in Neolithic times. Therefor, it is considered one of the most important sites of prehistoric cave art in the world.\n\nAs if all of that wasn't enough, Tassili n'Ajjer National Park boast some stunning Saharan landscapes.

Centuries of changing climates and erosion have resulted in stunning geological formations of eroded sandstone rocks, creating an almost lunar landscape with so-called \"rock forests\" often reaching as far the eye can see.

Hitchhiking is a possibility, but comes with all the obvious risks. There is a bus to the Libyan border, but the prices for that trip are high and rising. In short, the main alternative to flying in, is driving in with you own (rented or not) vehicle. The road is long and mostly without great landscapes, but for independent travellers an overland approach was the preferred method for a long time. However, after the 2003 kidnappings regulations for overland travel tightened, making guides compulsory and off-track driving off-limits. As a result of these rules and the bureaucratic hassle that came with it, prices rose significantly.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nAccess to the park and its sites is restricted, and you'll need to buy a permit to enter, plus a separate one if you want to take pictures.

There is no road to the top, but you can choose from 3 passes: Afilalet, Assakao, and Aroun. Dromedaries can only access the Assakao pass, but donkeys manage all three options. As trips to the top take several days, count on taking lots of water and of course camping equipment. \n\nArranging a tour and supplies is relatively easy, as there are many small travel agencies around.
