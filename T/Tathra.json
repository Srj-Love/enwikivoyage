A real surprise for a restaurant in such a sleepy village, Fat Tony's Bar & Grill has a great menu selection. Two minuses to this place are the price, which while fantastic value probably rules out regular visits for a few people. The second minus is the beer. A good selection, but in true Australian fashion comes at just above freezing, is a low volume and tasteless. In defence of Fat tony's, this is Australia and so is to be expected."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-36.73"],["149.97"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["South Coast (New South Wales)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Oceania\/Australia\/New_South_Wales\/Localities\/T\/Tathra\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Tathra, New South Wales"]]}]
