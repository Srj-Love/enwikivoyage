There have been reports that the area is closed, however it was opened in June 2013, passport check before entering the area. There are sleeping rooms at a chapel on the premises (about 2,000 kyat). There are several routes up and down, best to hire a motorcycle driver in Taungoo (16,000 kyat). The trip takes about 2 hr one-way, through teak forests. Coffee plantation at the top.
