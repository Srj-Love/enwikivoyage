Pristine rainforest covers much of the island and around 80% of this is protected by forest reserve and the Bouma National Heritage Park. Taveuni offers the visitor a rich natural history, in particular, a fine array of birdlife. Fortunately, unlike the rest of Fiji, the mongoose was never released or introduced to Taveuni and consequently many birds that have disappeared on the Main Islands still thrive here on Taveuni.\n\nTaveuni was once home to fierce warriors; Taveuni locals still exude pride and confidence in their personalities and are called one of the most friendly people in the islands of Fiji - which is saying quite something!\n\nTaveuni has a population of about 12,000 inhabitants, and is sparsely populated.  Virtually all of the local residents live in traditional villages. Once known for its coconut plantations, Taveuni’s attractions include world-class diving, dozens if not hundreds of waterfalls and an array of indigenous flora and fauna.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]}," \n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fijiairways.com\/ Fiji Airways"]}," (Fiji majority owned) flies to Taveuni from Nadi and Suva.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bouma National Heritage Park"]},".

The lower waterfall is an easy 15 minute walk, the middle fall is a moderate walk for 45 minutes and the upper fall can be reached in another one hour moderate to challenging walk.

Fed by rich nutrients that emerge from the depths of the Tongan trench, Taveuni is famous for its multitude of tropical, pelagic fish.  However, if there is one trademark or signature species in the area, it is soft coral, which billows and undulates in the currents.\n \nSoft coral comes in dramatic, sometimes electric hues of orange, red, pink and white, which is fringed by purple. \n\nWhile the diving in the Taveuni area is stunning and virtually unscathed by the 21st century, it is not generally a place to bring absolute novice divers. The currents can be strong and unwieldy for those unaccustomed to them and one should have some prior experience as a diver before venturing here. This is true when diving the Somosomo Strait, a relatively narrow waterway located between Taveuni and Vanua Levu. Along the southeast shore of Vanua Levu one will find a barrier reef continually fed by micro-organisms washed by the currents driven by the narrowing of the fun eel-like strait. \n\nProtruding into the strait from the Vanua Levu side to about 3km from the shores of Taveuni is a magnificent reef, called Rainbow Reef.",{"type":"<","value":["br"]}," \nHere one can find one of the most famous dive sites in the South Pacific, the Great White Wall.  It is named because of the unusual soft coral that inhabit the area. Starting at a depth of about 15m and continuing to over 65m, this underwater escarpment is covered with an almost luminescent white coral tinged with lavender.  There are a great number of other dive sites sprinkled throughout the area and new attractions are found all the time. It is estimated that only 5% of the entire reef system in the Taveuni area has been explored by divers and it's not unusual to see pelagics such as dolphins, turtles, eagle rays and a number of species of shark.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Fishing"]},"\nPristine and abundant waters surround your home base of Taveuni Island, Fiji.

Within the day range, anglers can expect to find all types of pelagic and reef fish as the topography is varied with ribbon reefs, pinnacles, islands, channels, outer reefs, straits and sandy flats. Every direction is full of possibilities for an exciting, productive day of fishing of world class trophies. Depending on the anglers' preference they can fish for Black Marlin, Blue Marlin, Swordfish, Sailfish, Wahoo, Mahi-mahi, Yellow fin, Big Eye Tuna and Albacore and depending on the fates they will catch them.
