According to Georgian legends, it was founded in the 5th century by King Vakhtang Gorgasali who, while hunting, shot a pheasant which fell into a warm spring and was either boiled or healed. Either way, the king was inspired to found a city on the site, and the name of the city derives from the Georgian word tbili meaning \"warm\". Although the city has been destroyed and rebuilt some 29 times, the layout of the Old Town is largely intact with narrow alleys and big crooked houses built around courtyards.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nTbilisi experiences relatively cold winters and hot summers. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild micro-climate compared to other cities that possess a similar continental climate along the same latitudes. - The average annual temperature in Tbilisi is 12.7 °C (54.9 °F). January is the coldest month with an average temperature of 0.9 °C (33.6 °F). July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24.4 °C (75.9 °F). The absolute minimum recorded temperature is −24 °C (−11 °F) and the absolute maximum is 40 °C (104 °F). Average annual precipitation is 568 mm (22.4 in). May and June are the wettest months (averaging 84 mm (3.3 in) of precipitation each) while January is the driest (averaging 20 mm (0.8 in) of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15–25 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and\/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Air.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["thumb"],["right"],["Tbilisi International Airport entrance\/exit"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["image=Tbilisi airport 1.jpg"],["name=Tbilisi International Airport"],["alt=",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TBS"]]},", Georgian: თბილისის საერთაშორისო აეროპორტი, Tbilisis saertasoriso aeroporti formerly Novo Alexeyevka International Airport"],["url=http:\/\/www.tbilisiairport.com\/"],["email=info.tbs@tav.aero"],["address=Airport St"],["lat=41.669167"],["long=44.954722"],["directions=17 km southeast of the city centre."],["phone=+995 32 310 265"],["fax=+995 32 310 322"],["hours="],["price="],["content= A new, modern terminal was inaugurated on February 7, 2007.
