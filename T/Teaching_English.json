Executives might need to handle complex negotiations in English — a task that requires not only excellent spoken English but also business skills and an awareness of cultural differences. Ideally, each of these groups would get a different English course.\n\nIn some situations, needs analysis is a formal process and courses are written to order for specific groups.

Among other things, it needs some understanding of how language works, quite a bit of patience, and considerable showmanship since non-verbal techniques such as gesture and facial expressions are often needed to scaffold the weaker linguistic understanding of the learner.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:American teacher, Marshallese English class.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["A class in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marshall Islands"]]}]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Esl-supplements.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["ESL supplements: fast and cheap"]]},"\nTeaching English ",{"type":"''","value":["as a second language"]}," is significantly different than teaching English literature and composition to a high school class of (mostly) native speakers, though of course there is some overlap as well. For one thing, an ESL teacher has to deal with a wider range of problems, notably pronunciation difficulties and spoken usage questions, such as when \"How are you?\" is more appropriate than \"How do you do?\" Also, even intelligent adult second language learners make grammar errors on things any eight-year-old native speaker gets 100% right; an ESL teacher has to teach and correct those. Also, you have to monitor and adjust your own English, speaking slowly and clearly, avoiding slang (or emphasizing it, depending on a needs analysis), sometimes explaining terms, and so on.\n\nAt any level, the teaching needs to be highly interactive. Too much talk by the teacher is fatal; you cannot teach language-using skills either by lecturing or (except in tiny groups) with a series of one-on-one interactions between the teacher and different students. You must set up situations for students to actually use the language. Often this means introducing some vocabulary and\/or grammatical structures on the board or in a listening or reading exercise, then setting up some sort of pairs or group task where students can try it out. Various sorts of discussion, role-playing or game activities are often used.\n\nA whole range of props are often used — maps to practice giving directions, newspaper clippings for reading comprehension or summary-writing practice, menus for a restaurant role-play, pictures for parts-of-the-body or parts-of-a-car, cartoons to provoke discussion, and so on. Sometimes the teacher must find or invent these; sometimes the school has a stock, as in the picture, or they can be borrowed from other teachers. It is fairly common for teachers working overseas to ask friends at home to mail them posters and other props, or to collect props themselves on visits home. If you are going abroad to teach, bring props or mail yourself a batch before leaving home.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Different levels "]},"\n\nGetting beginners started speaking English is difficult; techniques include translation, mime, pictures, and a lot of repetition. With young learners, you may be able to make a game of it. Patience and a sense of humour are essential; attempts to communicate when language skills are very limited are hard on both student and teacher.\n\nWith intermediate students, you get questions that strain your knowledge of your own language. If \"He doesn't have much money\" is OK, what is wrong with \"He has much money\"? Which is better: \"a big red balloon\" or \"a red big balloon\"? Why? Is the other incorrect or just unusual? Training and grammar reference books can help here, but sometimes the answer is just \"That is the way we do it.\"\n\nFrom advanced students, you get even more difficult questions on grammar and usage. Also, especially in ESP settings, you may need considerable knowledge beyond the language itself. For example, to teach business English above a certain level, you must know quite a bit about business. You need not be as expert as the students, though. For example, to teach medical English, you need not be a doctor but training and experience as a nurse would be extremely useful, a degree in biology would help, and at least a good understanding of high-school-level biology is probably essential.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Certificates"]},"\nAnyone contemplating more than a bit of casual work in this field should seriously\nconsider getting some training. Training can make it a good deal easier to survive\nin a classroom and can help you be a better teacher. A certificate may make it easier\nto get a job, or to get one of the better ones. Also, in some countries a degree\nis legally required to get a working visa; there is some hope of negotiating your\nway around this if you have a TEFL certificate, but almost none without it. \n\nThere are a number of different ESL\/EFL teaching certificates available.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Many schools give their own courses to staff."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Various companies in Western countries offer programs, often including job placement help."]},{"type":"*","value":[" There are online courses."]},"Most programs include some classroom experience and can be completed in one to three months.\n\nThere is no such thing as an international TEFL accrediting body.

Checking on a random day (not in the peak hiring season which is around July for a September start) there were over 50 new ads in the previous week for China, over 100 for Korea, over 50 for the rest of the world. Some of those employers advertise more-or-less continuously, some have many jobs on offer, and Dave's is by no means the only site with jobs, so overall demand is very high.\n\nThere are a few places where it is difficult to go as an ESL teacher. Some countries, like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Korea"]]},", are almost completely closed; others, like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burma"]]}," are just opening up after decades of being closed and might be quite interesting but perhaps still difficult. Your own government may forbid you to go to others; for example, an American cannot legally teach in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuba"]]},". Jobs are occasionally advertised in war-torn countries like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Afghanistan"]]},", but taking such a post would be too risky for most.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:US Army 52869 Title.jpg"],["thumb"],["Overseas students in the US"]]},"\nIt is also difficult to go to English-speaking countries. Australia does not need Americans to teach them English, and vice versa. There are ESL jobs in those countries — mainly teaching immigrants or foreign students — and some might be open to foreigners who meet the visa requirements (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Working abroad"]]}," and country articles), but they do not recruit abroad or provide expatriate benefits as ESL jobs elsewhere do. They may also be somewhat harder to get since employers may prefer locally-recognised qualifications or a local accent.\n\nWith those exceptions, there are ESL jobs almost anywhere. There are plenty of jobs in all the areas listed above and some in almost any non-English-speaking country. Areas like sub-Saharan ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Africa"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oceania"],["Pacific"]]}," islands do not have huge numbers of jobs, but they do have some. Given reasonable qualifications (preferably a degree and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Certificates"],["TESL certification"]]},"), the question is more \"Where would I like to go?\" than \"Where can I find a job?\".\n\nThere are many factors to consider in choosing a destination. Some prefer a destination not too wildly different from home, perhaps ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Western Europe"]]},"; others want to go somewhere really exotic such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mongolia"]]},". Some might want both, a basically European civilisation but still fascinatingly exotic: perhaps ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peru"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prague"]]},"? Any of these are possible. Some jobs are in major tourism centers such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rio"]]},", others in out-of-the-way but interesting places like the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maldives"]]},". Areas such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Middle East"]]}," generally offer higher salaries, but in terms of buying power you might be better off with lower pay in a low-cost country such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambodia"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bolivia"]]},". The same applies within countries; major cities often have higher pay than rural areas, but higher expenses. \n\nLanguage can be a major factor. If you already speak a foreign language, it will be relatively easy for you to live in a region where it is spoken. Some teachers choose a destination partly because of a desire to learn the language, or to  improve their language skills. This often implies a preference for countries where an important language is spoken — for example ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]}," rather than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finland"]]},", or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]}," rather than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mongolia"]]},". Teaching in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Latin America"]]}," may appeal for many reasons, not least because Spanish or Portuguese are much easier for an English speaker than Arabic or Chinese. It is also somewhat easier for speakers of European languages to learn English than for speakers of unrelated languages, but both students and teachers still have to work at it. See also ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#University programs"],["university programs"]]}," below and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["language tourism"]]},".\n\nPlaces like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malaysia"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," offer a nice combination. There are jobs for foreign ESL teachers, but many local people speak English well so these places can be much easier to live in than elsewhere.\n\nIn ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]}," there are few jobs for foreigners teaching English; plenty of Indians already speak excellent English and some of those are trained teachers. There are jobs for specialists, such as teaching English literature at university level or doing teacher training, but most of these require a Masters or Doctorate. For less qualified teachers, there is only one large group of non-volunteer jobs. India (especially ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangalore"]]},") has many call centers for Western companies outsourcing customer support work. Those centers routinely hire fairly large numbers of people — mostly American\/Canadian English speakers, but some for other accents or languages — as accent and cultural coaches for their phone workers, and they prefer to hire people with ESL training and\/or experience. The money is very good for India, but these tend to be fairly high-pressure jobs like anything in a call center. Also, the hours are often rather odd; you need to be on duty at whatever the peak times are in the clients' time zones. If the clients work 9-5 New York time, then your working day runs 7 pm to 3 am in Bangalore.\n\nThe job picture in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philippines"]]}," is similar to that for India — not many jobs for foreign ESL teachers but call centers do hire some.\n\nIn the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["European Union"]]}," many employers prefer to hire teachers from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Britain"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ireland"]]}," because citizens of those countries do not need work visas. Some employers are reluctant to hire anyone who does need a visa; others will hire qualified teachers from anywhere, and a few show a specific preference for American\/Canadian accents.\n\nFor country-specific information, see the Work sections of country articles. For some destinations, see also ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tips for travel in developing countries"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Pay and conditions "]},"\n\nNearly all ESL jobs that hire from overseas include worthwhile benefits, though there is great variation from country to country and employer to employer. A free apartment and annual two-way airfare home are common, though not all employers provide them. Most contracts are for a year, though some provide salary for only a 10-month school year. University or public school jobs often have quite long holidays. \n\nLanguage teachers typically do not get the high salaries and juicy benefits package that an expatriate sent by a company to handle overseas business would. In particular, education for any children you have may be a problem. International schools are generally quite expensive and few ESL employers (except in the Middle East) cover this. The local schools may not suit your kids.\n\nIn lower income countries a language teacher's pay is generally enough to live well there, but not much by the standards of higher income places. For example, $1000 US a month plus a free apartment lets you live quite well in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},"; local teachers are making considerably less and paying rent on their apartments. You can afford to travel some in the holidays, even visit nearby low-cost countries like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vietnam"]]},", and in most jobs the employer covers most or all of the cost for an annual trip home. However it would be almost impossible to pay off debts back home, or to plan a trip to Japan, on that income. In the same region, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korea"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiwan"]]}," have higher salaries, enough to save some despite higher living costs.\n\nIt is also common for schools to hire locally for summer programs, for part-time work, and sometimes for full time employment. These jobs often have fewer benefits than the overseas-hired posts.\n\nThe best pay for language teachers is generally in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Middle East"]]},". They can afford to be choosy, though; most jobs there require a degree and TEFL certificate, and some require an MA. Some jobs in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Western Europe"]]}," also pay quite well, but living costs are high.\n\nThere are also some highly paid jobs training oil workers; usually these involve an on\/off cycle — 42 days on-site working long hours, then 21 days away or some such — with the employer paying for a flight out every cycle and providing both housing and food when you are on-site. Most of these want good qualifications — typically degree, CELTA and five years experience. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Hours "]},"\nFor most classes, considerable planning and preparation is needed to produce reasonable quality lessons. A language teacher's workload is generally 15 to 20 contact hours a week; with preparation time, marking, staff meetings and so on, that is a full time job. Generally, there are some extra-curricular activities as well.\n\nThere are exceptions. With small advanced classes, sometimes all you need to do is start a discussion. Preparation consists mainly of choosing a topic; students just grab it and run. Or for some classes, you may be given a carefully laid out program with a textbook, student workbook and sometimes even presentation slides provided; such courses require less preparation. On the other hand, some schools will just dump you in the deep end (\"Here's your class; teach it!\") with no materials, and sometimes with other problems like no photocopier or Internet, or a class where students have wildly different levels of English. In those cases, you put in quite a bit of extra time.\n\nThere can of course be problems with this. It is fairly common for employers to want up to 25 classroom hours a week, and 30 is not unheard of. Management and teachers fairly often disagree on the importance of various meetings and paperwork. Some schools push the extracurricular stuff too far, requiring a lot of (usually unpaid) additional duties. Some rent their teachers out to local schools, which often means you have quite a lot of (usually unpaid) travel time. At some schools, nearly all classes are on evenings and weekends, or \"split shift\" schedules (where you teach say 9-11 in the morning then 7-9 at night) are fairly common. The worst schools may have several of these problems together; they tend to burn out teachers, to be unable to keep staff, and to be continually advertising jobs. Beware of such schools!\n\nOn the other hand, some teachers assume that showing up for class is all they have to do, wandering in with no preparation and inventing a lesson plan as they cross the threshold of the classroom. Expert teachers may be able to pull this off occasionally, but making a habit of it or trying it without a lot of experience generally leads to disaster. Teaching ESL is not just part of your holiday; it is a demanding job and needs to be taken seriously.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Risks "]},"\nThere is some risk in taking any overseas job. \n\nIf you travel somewhere and then look for work, you avoid some of the risks but you incur expenses. Also you may miss out on benefits; free housing and annual airfare home are more-or-less standard when hiring from overseas, but less common for local hires. Finally, you will likely not be able to get a working visa in advance since you don't have a job. Depending on local regulations, this may be a minor detail or a major hassle. \n\nOn the other hand, if you are recruited from half a world away, it is hard to know exactly what you are getting into or who you are dealing with.

Do a web search on the city name along with terms like \"pollution\", \"corruption\" and \"gang\"; you might expect a few hits for almost any city, but if there's a big problem, this may turn it up. If having modern conveniences and Western food is important to you, check websites for major international retail chains like Ikea or the European supermarkets Metro and Carrefour to see if they have stores there.

See also the Work sections of our country articles.\n\nAs with everything in the ESL business, some caution is required; some sites are run by recruiters (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Recruiters"],["cautions below"]]},") and some have been accused of censoring discussions in their forums to protect their advertisers from criticism.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Professional associations"]},"\nThere are two major professional associations for ESL teachers, US-based ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tesol.org\/ TESOL"]}," and British-based ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.iatefl.org\/ IATEFL"]},". Both are international organisations whose members come from all over and are working all around the world. Both publish journals (available in university libraries) and run a website and an annual conference. The journals and websites have job ads and the conferences have a hiring fair. Like most academic organizations, these are more applicable to teachers of TEFL at the university level where service involvement is required for tenure and promotion; the majority of TEFL teachers have little or no involvement with them.\n\nTeachers in many countries have established ELT teaching associations; many are set up as regional affiliates of either TESOL or IATEFL. Like any other job search, networking and finding the people who are \"in the know\" is a great way to find a job or to learn more about local conditions:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Arabia — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tesolarabia.org\/index.php\/ TESOL Arabia"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangladesh"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/belta-bd.org\/nw\/ BELTA"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Korea"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kotesol.org\/ KOTESOL"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian Far East"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/feelta.wl.dvgu.ru\/ FEELTA"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philippines"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.palt-elt.org\/ PALT"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.elltas.org\/ ELLTAS"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.thaitesol.org\/ Thailand TESOL"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiwan"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.eta.org.tw\/tw\/index.asp ETA-ROC"]}]},"\nAt the very least, read the appropriate site to get a feel for the issues that are important in the country you wish to work in.

Look for conference announcements and plan a visit; these are excellent chances to look for work.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Governments of destination countries"]},"\n\nA few countries have government-run programs for recruiting foreign teachers:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chile"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.thisischile.cl\/7239\/2\/wanted-native-speakers-to-teach-english-in-chile-in-2012\/News.aspx English Opens Doors"]}," (Volunteer posts with very low pay)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.frenchculture.org\/spip.php?rubrique424&tout=ok English Assistant Program"]}," (Available to US citizens only)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.emb.gov.hk\/index.aspx?nodeID=262&langno=1 NET"]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jetprogramme.org\/ JET"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Korea"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.epik.go.kr\/ EPIK"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," — ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mecd.gob.es\/eeuu\/convocatorias-programas\/convocatorias-eeuu\/auxiliares-conversacion-eeuu.html Convocatorias"]}]},"\nThese generally take new university graduates and do not require teacher training or experience. However, you may be posted to a rural school where you're the only foreigner for miles around — great for experiencing local culture, not so great if you wanted to move in with your girl\/boyfriend in Tokyo\/Seoul.\n\nMost of these jobs pay fairly well for entry-level posts, often a bit more than training centers offer to beginning teachers. For example, as of 2013 the Japanese JET program pays ¥3,360,000 (about $33,000) in the first year with increases in subsequent years. These jobs also look fairly good on a resume; anyone hiring English teachers in the region is likely to know these programs and if your next job application will be back home, then listing a national Ministry of Education as your last employer sounds much better than Tomiko's English Academy.\n\nIn some countries the State, Province or other entity in charge of education for many cities will also assist schools in finding staff.  Contacting the education department directly can lead you to schools needing foreign ESL teachers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Governments of English-speaking countries"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.britishcouncil.org\/home British Council"]}]}," is the British government's educational and cultural department. Among other things, they are ",{"type":"'''","value":["the largest English teaching organisation in the world"]},", running schools in many places.\n\nThe Council also handle recruiting for various foreign governments' English programs. Say\nElbonia needs a few dozen teachers, or a few higher-level specialists like teacher trainers or curriculum and test designers; the Council will advertise, collect resumes, and produce a short list\nof candidates. For the actual interviews, senior Elbonian staff can fly to London and use Council\nfacilities to interview, or the Council can handle the interviews too.\n\nFor some of these jobs, the Council also provides guarantees for teachers; if a corrupt school official steals your pay or you need to bail out because of a revolution in Elbonia, some Council contracts require compensation and the Council pays it even if they cannot collect from the other government. This does not completely remove the risks, of course, but it does reduce them significantly.   \n\nCouncil jobs can be searched\non their web site or look for ads in the Guardian and the Times Education Supplement\nor Higher Ed. Supplement. Some, but by no means all, of their jobs are restricted\nto British citizens. Most interviews are in London. British Council schools may also\nhire locally wherever they are, but these jobs usually do not have benefits like airfare\nand housing that the London-hired ones do.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["US State Department"]}," also has an ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/exchanges.state.gov\/education\/engteaching\/  English teaching program"]},". Another program, paid for by government and run by Georgetown university, sends ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/elf.georgetown.edu\/ teacher trainers and other experts"]}," abroad; it requires a masters degree and US citizenship.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" The big chains "]},"\n\nThere are a number of large companies in the ESL business, such as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.englishfirst.com\/index.html English First"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/ihworld.com\/ International House"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wallstreetinstitute.com\/ Wall Street English"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.berlitz.com\/ Berlitz"]},".  The British Council (",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Governments_of_English-speaking_countries"],["see above"]]},") might be considered another in this class, though it is rather different in some ways. Any of these has dozens of schools in multiple countries, and all of them are more-or-less continuously recruiting teachers.\n\nThere are substantial advantages to working for such a company, especially for novice teachers. Any of them tends to hire experienced managers, to offer training for teachers, and to pay at competitive (though not always generous) rates. Perhaps more important, none of them are at all likely to try the tricks that sleazy recruiters or schools sometimes get up to, such as avoiding the cost of a proper visa by asking teachers to work illegally on a tourist visa or making large profits while paying teachers a pittance as \"volunteers\". These are professional organisations, not fly-by-night operators; that is good to know when you contemplate the risks inherent in working abroad, and it may also make one of them look better on your resume than a smaller company.\n\nAnother benefit is that, given experience in one of these companies, it may be relatively easy to move to another location or to a different job. Consider a teacher who has done a few year's ESL in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indonesia"]]}," and is ready for a change; any such teacher could look for work in, say, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prague"]]}," and have a reasonable chance of finding it. However, a teacher with one of the big companies can seek work at the same company's schools in those places; he or she is likely to have it significantly easier, both in finding work and in adapting to the new school on arrival. Also, if you want to make a career in ESL, there may be more opportunities in a large company; there are jobs in management, teacher training and materials development that you can hope to move into.\n\nThat said, there is a downside. For one thing, most such companies are franchise operations so conditions at a particular school depend on the local franchise owner as well as the global organisation. Some reports on expatriate-in-wherever bulletin boards claim that certain schools in large chains are utterly awful places to work, generally because at that particular school either the franchise owner or the foreign manager is a twit. Such reports need to be taken with a grain of salt and it is quite common to hear that one location is terrible while another nearby is just fine, but some caution is indicated.\n\nAlso, in many cases an experienced teacher with some knowledge of a country can find a better job than these places offer — one with more money, shorter hours, longer holidays or less stress, and sometimes more than one of those.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Recruiters "]},"\n\nA common piece of advice on expatriate-in-wherever discussion sites is to ",{"type":"''","value":["never consider taking a job if a recruiter is involved"]},". That is likely overstated — other people posting on the same sites often disagree, and some even recommend particular recruiters as honest and useful — but treating recruiters with considerable caution is almost always advisable. In  many cases, they create more problems rather than solving any.\n\nNote that this includes various \"job search\" sites which do not give contact information for actual employers, or even for recruiters other than the company running the site; these are just thinly disguised advertising for a particular recruiter and should be either shunned entirely or used with caution. It also includes various organisations in Western countries that offer ESL training followed by \"placement assistance\". The training may be useful (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Certificates"],["certificates"]]}," above), but after that they are just a recruiter and should be treated with caution. \n\nSome recruiters want an up-front payment from teachers, a \"membership fee\", \"placement fee\" or whatever. In nearly all cases, these should be ",{"type":"''","value":["rejected out-of-hand"]},". Honest recruiters make their money by getting commissions from schools; any who ask for payment from teachers are quite likely scammers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Other ways to teach abroad "]},"\nThere are many other ways to live abroad. See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Working abroad"]]}," for some details. Here we cover those that involve teaching.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Teachers from other fields "]},"\nIf you have teaching qualification in your own country — but as, say a biology or history or even English literature teacher — then many English teaching jobs will happily accept you, though some will want an ESL certificate as well.\n\nWith such qualifications, consider looking for work at ",{"type":"'''","value":["International schools"]},". These are for the children of expatriates. As a rule, the fees for such schools are paid by companies or governments who send staff abroad; both their educational standards and their pay rates are similar to those back home, quite often a bit higher. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pay and conditions are generally much better than language teachers get"]},". In addition, free education for your own children is often included.\n\nThese schools generally want the same qualifications as primary or secondary schools back home, but there is some variation. All want certified teachers, but some restrict that to certifications from a particular country or even state, while others will happily hire certified teachers from anywhere in the English-speaking world. A few will also hire well-qualified ESL teachers — typically degree and CELTA — without schoolteacher certification. Many international schools also look for two years teaching experience in addition to formal qualifications. Many schools conduct interviews on Skype.\n\nThere is a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cois.org\/ Council of International Schools"]}," and an ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.iss.edu\/about-us\/iss-directory International Schools Services directory"]},"; both sites also have teacher recruitment links. A company called ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.search-associates.com\/associates\/fair_info.cfm Search Associates"]}," handles recruiting for a number of schools and runs job fairs in large cities around the world. Many of those schools teach the International Baccalaureate — a high school diploma that most universities in any English-speaking country will accept — so another way to find schools is through the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ibo.org\/ IB site"]},".\n\nYou could also ask embassies or companies with many expatriate staff what schools they use. A web search for \"international school\" plus the name of a country or city will also turn some up, but be aware that \"international school\" is sometimes (certainly in China, possibly elsewhere as well) purely a marketing term, used in promoting any school that teaches some English.\n\nCertified ",{"type":"'''","value":["Montessori"]}," teachers can also find work in many countries.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Teaching other languages "]},"\nOf course English is not the only language for which there is demand.
