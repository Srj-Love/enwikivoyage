In 1970 Charlie Erwin, a developer from Charlotte, purchased this 1600 acre \"beautiful peninsula\" and called it by its Tahitian name - Tega Cay.  The South Seas theme was carried out in street names such as Molokai, Pago Pago and Kailua, and in the architecture.  The city has sixteen miles of shoreline, a rugged topography and is densely wooded with pines and hardwoods.\nDuring the 1970s, the developer's financial difficulties led ultimately to bankruptcy.  The Property Owners Association elected to establish a political subdivision.  The City of Tega Cay was incorporated in 1982, on the fourth of July, with much fanfare.  Each fourth of July the City celebrates its birthday with ceremonies, parades, fireworks, games, and the cutting of the ceremonial birthday cake with a military saber.  At the ceremonies, a new star is added to the City flag that was especially designed for the first celebration.  The number of stars indicates the age of the City.\nThe City has a Mayor-Council form of government.  The Mayor and Council persons are elected to serve four year staggered terms with elections held every two years.  The Mayor is the Chief Administrative officer who oversees the daily operation of City government.\nThe Fire Department and Rescue Squad members are all volunteers.  Both receive financial support from the City.  There are no schools in the City; the students attend Fort Mill Township schools, which are noted for their excellence.  All utilities are underground and privately owned including water, sewer, power, telephone, and TV cables.\nTega Cay offers golfers the only 27-hole public golf course in the South Charlotte area.  Each nine is different.  The Grande View, just one year old, is getting rave reviews for its mountain-like changes of elevation and spectacular views.  The Cove requires an accurate iron game especially on the par three 6th hole that crosses a cove of Lake Wylie.  Refurbishing all the greens of the Carolina Pines began this summer\nThe City has two waterfront parks, two lighted ball fields and several small interior parks.  In 1997 the City constructed a 1 1\/2 mile long paved pedestrian pathway adjacent to Tega Cay Drive.  A new YMCA Wellness Center, located just outside the City, opened in August 1999.  It has state of the art equipment and a trained staff of professionals.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nBy plane\nCharlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) is on the west side of town near Billy Graham Parkway.
