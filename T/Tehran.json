A bustling metropolis of 14 million people, it is situated at the foot of the towering Alborz mountain range.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Aerial View of Tehran 26.11.2008 04-35-03.JPG"],["thumb"],["right"],["320px"],["Tehran is a metropolis of 14 million situated at the foot of the towering Alborz range."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nTehran is a cosmopolitan city, with great museums, parks, restaurants, warm friendly people. It deserves at least a few days of your Iranian itinerary.\n\nThe city can be roughly divided into two different parts - north and south. The northern districts of Tehran are more prosperous, modern, cosmopolitan and expensive while southern parts is less attractive but cheaper.\n\nAt the time of the Zand dynasty, it was a little town that was significant from a strategic point of view. The first of the Qajar kings, Agha Mohammed Khan, named Tehran as the country's capital in 1778, and most of its growth started during the reign of a subsequent Qajar monarch, Fath-Ali Shah. The castle which Agha Mohammed Khan had built was to contain the new majestic buildings.\n\nAt the same time, the city's populace was redoubled. Due to the increasing significance of the city, gates, squares and mosques were built and it was at the time of Nassereddin Shah that the city's master sketch was prepared and modern streets were constructed. Later, huge central squares like Toopkhaneh square (now Imam Khomeini) and quite a few military buildings were built. Even though the Qajar dynasty was in a period of decline, Tehran soon took the shape of a modern city. The structure of large government buildings, new streets, recreation centres, urban service organizations, and academic and methodical centres were started, even as most of the old gates and buildings were destroyed and the city's old architectural fabric replaced by a contemporary one.\n\nTehran has also earned itself the rather unenviable reputation as a smog-filled, traffic-clogged and featureless sprawl of concrete bursting at the seams with 14 million residents. But you can also find an endless number of nice and cosy places in and around the city - if you know where to look. Tehran is also a city of parks and possesses more than 800 of them, all well-kept. The city is nearly a mile high above sea level and as a result is cooler than other cities in the middle east. Summer temperatures are around 32°C or about 90-95°F. The air tends to be very dry.\n\nA combination of factors make Tehran a pleasant place to visit: The dry climate which is constantly cool (at least in the evenings), the proximity of the mountains, the parks and gardens where flowers blossom all through the year, the alleys of trees in the avenues or even smaller streets, and even the water that runs down from the upper city along deep and wide gutters which look like small rivers during spring.  The Alborz range on the north of Tehran, which hosts the highest peak in Iran, provides fantastic conditions for ski lovers in the winter. In winter, the mountain hotels and ski-clubs at Shemshak, and Dizine are full several days a week. Some specialist skiers consider the snow value in northern Tehran to be one of the most excellent in the world.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tehran's Mehrabad airport"],["alt=",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["THR"]]}],["url=http:\/\/mehrabad.airport.ir\/HomePage.aspx?TabID=0&Site=mehrabad.airport&Lang=fa-IR"],["email="],["address="],["lat=35.69097"],["long=51.31868"],["directions=Azadi Square Subway Station 1.0km and the abundant taxis available are definitely the best way to get into Tehran."],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=is the old pre-revolution airport.

A taxi to any destination in Tehran costs from 200,000 Rials for a local Samand car, or a few dollars more for Toyota Camry. You can also bargain with taxis who take passengers from Tehran to the Imam Khomeini airport because they usually have to go back to Tehran empty.

Each bus line has a certain and almost invariable path but only people know exactly which bus stations exist for a certain road.

(mostly happening during the times when the number of waiting taxis exceeds the number of passengers). In this case, they would wait until the car gets full of passengers (mostly one people at front and 3 people at back, excluding the driver). Otherwise the people have to line up in a queue waiting for the taxis to come. This is the case during rush hours (approximately 7AM-8AM and 5PM-8PM).

Common sense and the usual precautions against pickpockets in bazaars and crowds should ensure your visit is hassle free.\n\nEven late at the mid-night it is safe in most parts of the city while you will find the city still crowded.

It goes without saying that you should just ignore such requests and head to the nearest police station if you feel unsafe. The trouble is that it can be a little hard for the untrained tourist eye to tell these from the real police.\n\nThe traffic in Tehran is very dangerous and should be considered some of the worlds worst. Try to cross the street when the locals do. At first it looks impossible but the drivers do a very good job to avoid pedestrians.\n\nGay and lesbian travellers should be extremely careful when travelling to Tehran due to strict and harsh regulations on homosexual activity. Iran justice has death penalty for homosexuals, even teenagers.\n\nExercising extreme caution in public is the key thing to remember, and in fact, it is mandatory to abstain from any kind of intimacy even for heterosexual couples, but it doesn't mean you cannot hold hands.\n\nIt is also required, even for non-Muslim women, to wear a head scarf or veil, on their head, when exiting their apartment or hotel rooms.\n\nIf you decide to smoke the qalyan (waterpipe), make sure that you are not smoking opium or other kinds of drugs if you don't intend to do it. Although drugs and alcohol are illegal in Iran, it is not impossible to obtain them, especially in Tehran.
