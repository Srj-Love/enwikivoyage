Tochal is the world's 4th highest ski resort at over 3,730 metres (12,240 ft) at its highest 7th station. The resort was completed in 1976 shortly before the overthrow of the Shah.\n\nHere, one must first ride the eight kilometres (five mile) long gondola lift which covers a huge vertical. The 7th station has three slopes. The resort's longest slope is the south side U shaped slope which goes from the 7th station to 5th station. The other two slopes are located on the north side of the 7th station. Here, there are two parallel chair ski lifts that go up to 3,900 metres (12,795 ft) near Tochal's peak (at 4,000 m\/13,125 ft), rising higher than the gondola 7th station. This altitude is higher than any of the European resorts.\n\nFrom the Tochal peak, one has a spectacular view of the Alborz range, including the 5,671 metre (18,606 ft) high Mt. Damavand, a dormant volcano.\n\nAt the bottom of the lifts in a valley behind the Tochal peak is Tochal hotel, located at 3,500 metres (11,483 ft) altitude. From there a T lift takes skiers up the 3,800 metres (12,500 ft) of Shahneshin peak, where the third slope of Tochal is.\n\nTochal 7th station has skiing eight months of the year. But there are also some glaciers and year-round snow fields near Tehran where skiing began in 1938, thanks to the efforts of two German railway engineers. Today, 12 ski resorts operate in Iran, but the most famous are Tochal, Dizin, and Shemshak, all within one to three hours of Tehran.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Darband hiking trail "]},{"type":"*","value":["Chitgar Park "]},{"type":"*","value":["Mellat Park "]},{"type":"*","value":["Laleh Park "]},{"type":"*","value":["Jamshidieh Park "]},{"type":"*","value":["Niavaran Park "]},{"type":"*","value":["Sa'ei Park "]},{"type":"*","value":["Shatranj Park "]},{"type":"*","value":["Tangeh Savashi "]},{"type":"*","value":["Darabad hiking trail "]},{"type":"*","value":["Darakeh hiking trail "]},{"type":"*","value":["Jahan-e Kudak Park "]},{"type":"*","value":["Azadi Sports complex "]},{"type":"*","value":["Enghelab Sports Complex and Golf course "]},{"type":"*","value":["Several caves, springs, and waterfalls outside Tehran.
