It is situated on the north bank of the estuary mouth of the River Teign in an area of the South Devon coast that is famed for its red sandstone cliffs. It has a population of approx 14,000.\n\nIn 1690, it was the last place in England to be invaded by a foreign power, when a contingent of the French fleet anchored of Torbay attacked the town. The town grew from a fishing port associated with the Newfoundland cod industry to a fashionable resort of some note in Georgian times, with further expansion after the opening of the South Devon Railway in 1846.\n\nToday, its port still operates and the town remains a popular seaside holiday location.\n\nEvery summer it hosts a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.teignmouthfolk.co.uk\/ folk festival"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.teignmouthjazz.org Jazz festival"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.teignmouthcarnival.co.uk carnival"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nTeignmouth has a train station located near the centre of town on the line from London Paddington to Penzance in Cornwall.
