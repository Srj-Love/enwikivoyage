The actual location of first Byzanthe was what is now Barbaros, a village 9 km southwest of Tekirdağ. It was then colonised by Greeks from the Aegean island of Samos. After the split of Roman Empire into two parts, Tekirdağ remained in Byzantine hands and in 14th century captured by Ottoman Turks who gave the city the name “Rodosçuk”. Its name underwent several changes and took its current form in 1927, in the early years of Turkish Republic.\n\nAlthough it is not the case with many languages today, Tekirdağ used to be called “",{"type":"'''","value":["Rodosto"]},"” in several European languages, after its Latin name used in Roman period, which itself derives from “Rhaidestos”, the Greek name of the city, long after this official renaming took place. In fact, Tekirdağ is still called “",{"type":"'''","value":["Rodostó"]},"” in Hungarian.\n\nThis is the city where Hungarian prince and independence movement leader ",{"type":"'''","value":["Francis II Rákóczi"]}," (also known as ",{"type":"''","value":["II.

The city is the provincial capital of Tekirdağ Province, which is named after the city.\n\nThe city is surrounded by the Sea of Marmara on one side, and by sunflower and grain fields\non the other. On the hillsides to the southwest, viniculture is an important activity.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nLocal climate is a curious mix of Mediterranean climate of the regions to the south and continental climate of the inland regions to the north, with the rain patterns resembling the Mediterranean climate, while temperature patterns are comparable to the continental one — moderately dry and hot summers (temperatures may rise to 35°C) and rainy, occasionally snowy, and cold winters (temperatures may drop to -8°C; however with the effect of relative humidity, it can even feel bitterly colder than that) in short. However unlike the typical Mediterranean climate, it can rain heavily even during the hottest month (August), although these showers do not last more than 20 minutes at most. Though it’s also possible that you can encounter consecutive weeks without a single drop of rain.\n\nAutumns are mild, long and very nice. It is the best time to swim—sea is warm, just like the air is—since the sea is usually cruelly wavy during summer but is very docile during September.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe nearest international airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Çorlu"]]}," Airport"]}," (about 50 km to Tekirdağ) but it is reserved only for flights from the ex-Soviet countries, as some of the airway companies of these countries spell peril on the Atatürk International Airport with their aging plane stock and pilots insisting on speaking only in Russian.

Minibuses, which wait for passengers right in front of the station in accordance with the train arrival schedule, connect the station with city centre for 1.50 TL pp, taking 10 minutes.

It is possible to find a bus to Tekirdağ about every 15 minutes, even every 5 minutes in summertime. Direct bus travel with the Asian side of Istanbul is less frequent, only once every few hours. From Istanbul’s Otogar to Tekirdağ doesn’t normally take more than two hours, but, especially in summertime, because many people heading for their “holiday homes” on the way to Tekirdağ use these services, stops can be tiresome, and can lengthen the travel time up to four hours when complemented with congested traffic. There is normally no scheduled stop on the Istanbul-Tekirdağ bus lines for a break.\n\nTicket fares from\/to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]}," are uniform across all bus companies and are 15 TL as of Sept 2010 (and a few liras more from slightly further away ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul\/Asian Side"],["Asian Side"]]}," of Istanbul). Because of rivalry, some companies sometimes lower their prices to around 10 TL, but these promotions are only occasional.\n\nIt may be wise to book your seat a week beforehand during the peak season (July–August) if you are going to either\n\ntravel from Istanbul to Tekirdağ on Fridays\n\nand\/or\n\ntravel from Tekirdağ to Istanbul on Sundays\n\nSome companies deny to book a seat during peak season, instead, insist on selling the ticket right away.\n\nBuses coming from Istanbul first enter Tekirdağ’s otogar, which is very tiny compared with Istanbul’s, and some proceed to outlying hoods of the city in the west, and some finish their journey right there. In summertime almost all buses end their trip in Kumbağ via Tekirdağ’s otogar and the avenue at the shoreline. To go to the downtown area (",{"type":"''","value":["Çarşı"]},", pronounced “char-sha”), you should either get off the bus at the shore and walk uphill for about 10 minutes or take one of the public busses (their stop is right next to the otogar).\n\nBuses heading for Istanbul from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Çanakkale"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gelibolu"]]}," passes through Tekirdağ, so it is possible to board an Istanbul bus from these places and get off in Tekirdağ. When buying the ticket or paying the fare inside the bus tell them that you’ll get off in Tekirdağ, not Istanbul, a journey which deserves a slightly lower fare than all the way to Istanbul (about 3-4 YTL less than full price for Istanbul).\n\nOne easy and cheap way reaching from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"]]}," to Tekirdağ by bus might be somehow to reach ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Keşan"]]}," first, which is about 25 km away from Greco-Turkish border, then take a bus there coming from Çanakkale, Gallipoli or already has its terminus in Keşan and heading for Istanbul.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\nThere are regular daily voyages from little harbour in the city centre to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marmara Island"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Avşa Island"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Erdek"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bandirma"]]}," across the Sea of Marmara (at least in summer months).

You can have your passport stamped if you are arriving by your own boat and haven’t disembarked in Turkey yet.

The ",{"type":"'''","value":["private minibuses"]}," usually don’t have route numbers, instead they are all painted different colours according to their routes.

Either carefully read the signs on the front window of the vehicle about where it goes to, or tell the driver the place name you want to go, he will either make an approval gesture (shaking his head downwards) or point to another minibus, which means “that one goes there”. These greenish-yellow minibuses are those exceptional ones to have route numbers and #1 goes into Değirmenaltı, so look for that.
