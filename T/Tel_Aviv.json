During the 19th century the town’s population grew from about 2,500 (1806) to 17,000 (1886). The old city walls could no longer contain the population, and they were destroyed in the 1870s. New, more spacious neighborhoods started to appear.\n\nTel Aviv (meaning literally \"Hill of Spring\") itself was founded in 1909 by a group of distinguished Jewish residents of Jaffa. They envisaged a European-style garden suburb, with wide streets and boulevards. Leaving Jaffa wasn’t, however, only a question of an upgrade in lifestyle. Moving out of the Arab-dominated town also represented their belief in the Jewish national movement, their belief in Zionism. \nBefore being a city, Tel Aviv was one of the many titles of Herzl's utopian Zionist book - ",{"type":"''","value":["The Old New Land"]},". Setting out with a grand vision, the 60 Tel Aviv founders started out by building the first mid-eastern urban center with running water, no small wonder in that part of the world in 1909.\n\nTel Aviv grew steadily under Ottoman law until WWI. By the end of the war the British took over the Holy Land: an event the Jewish community saw as encouraging, while the Muslim community viewed it as a turn for the worse after Islamic rule.  It was also the site of many Palestinian villages and was seen to be a creation of imperialist rule seeing as it was developed as a symbol of a returning diaspora many Palestinians had never known in the countless generations they'd lived there. In May 1921, an Arab mob attacked a Jewish immigration center, killing dozens of Jews. Another group broke the windows of stores in the Jewish street in Jaffa, and a mob armed with knives and sticks made its way towards Tel Aviv. \nBefore 1921 most Jews worked and lived in Jaffa; after the attack, thousands of the 16,000 Jews of Jaffa moved north to Tel Aviv. The suburb had become a city and within a decade, Tel Aviv had become the center of culture, commerce and light industry for the entire Jewish population of the country as well as the British soldiers. 1938 marked the opening of Tel Aviv port, an important milestone in the end of its dependency on Jaffa. By this time, Tel Aviv was already the biggest city in the country, with 130,000 residents. After Israel’s declaration of independence in 1948, Jaffa became a district of Tel Aviv and the city's name was officially changed to Tel Aviv-Yafo.\n\nToday, Tel Aviv-Yafo represents the heart of a thriving, Israeli metropolis - the greater metropolitan area comprises a number of separate municipalities with approximately 3.1 million people living in a 25 km long sprawl along the Mediterranean coast - with around 392,700 in Tel Aviv-Yafo itself making it the second largest city in Israel after ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jerusalem"]]},"(760,800 inhabitants).

It is known as \"the city that doesn't stop\" and indeed you will find that the nightlife and culture are on around the clock. In summer it is not unusual to see the beach boardwalk bustling with people at 4AM and the clubs and bars usually pick up around midnight until morning, giving Tel Aviv a well deserved reputation of being a party town. It is the pinnacle of secular life in Israel.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Beit Rekanatti.jpg"],["thumb"],["Tel Aviv \"White City\" was declared a cultural ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage site"]]}]]}," \nIn July 2003 Tel Aviv-Yafo was declared a cultural ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage site"]]}," for the many \"International\" style (also known as Bauhaus after the German school it originated from) buildings built in the city during the 1930s-50s. As this style emphasized simplicity and the white color, Tel Aviv is also called the ",{"type":"'''","value":["White City"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\nTel Aviv lies alongside the Mediterranean coastline. With few exceptions, all points of interest for tourists are in a rectangle defined by the sea to the west, the Yarkon River to the north, the Ayalon highway to the east, and Salame Road to the south. This rectangle is separated into two long strips by Ibn Gabirol Street, starting from the Yarkon River and changing its name to Yehuda Halevy. Most of the attractions are in the west of these strips.\n\nTel Aviv developed from south to north. To the south-western corner of the rectangle you will find old Jaffa. To its north, is the first Jewish neighborhood outside Jaffa, Neve Tzedek (meaning \"Oasis of Justice\"). To Neve Tzedek’s east is Florentin, a 1920s light-industry quarter founded by Jews from Salonika in Greece that in recent years has turned into a trendy neighborhood for young people, albeit one with a large population of older and poor people; and then the Central Bus Station area, now home to foreign workers from around the world.\n\nTo the north of Neve Tzedek is \"Kerem Ha'Temanim\" (the Yemenite Vineyard), a crowded but picturesque neighborhood dating to the early 20th century and east and north of here lies the city center, a chiefly residential area built in the 1920s and 1930s, where the majority of Bauhaus (\"International\") style architecture is to be found. Further north and east, the \"old north\" (not to be confused with \"the north\" on the other side of the Yarkon), is a more spacious residential area built during the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nTel Aviv residents often speak of a north-south divide in Tel Aviv-Yafo. The north is usually associated with a continental, chic, and suburbanite lifestyle centered around Kikar haMedina and \"Ramat Aviv\". To the south, the city takes on a more working-class and eastern, albeit evermore trendy, urban feel. A crude divide would be that all neighborhoods north of the Yarkon River are considered \"north\"; the area between the sea in the west, Ayalon Highway in the east, Yarkon River in the north and Salame Street in the south is considered \"central\" Tel Aviv. The area south of Salame Street is generally south Tel Aviv, and Jaffa lies to the South-West. \nNorth Tel Aviv is generally more residential and family-oriented; central Tel Aviv is the hipper-younger area with many single people and couples in their 20s and 30s; south Tel Aviv is a rapidly gentrifying area with a mixed population - from older working-class people to artists to migrant African workers.\n\nTel Aviv is likely the most liberal city in Israel and in the Middle East - as it is no less liberal than Western Europe's liberally-inclined major cities. It has a bustling civil society and is home to many activist movements and NGOs. Its residents tend to have liberal attitudes towards gay and lesbian rights, and, in fact, Tel Aviv hosts the largest gay pride parade in Israel (the only country in the Middle East where homosexuality is not considered illegal). It is also a destination for gay Palestinian refugees, unable to pursue their lifestyle in the Palestinian territories. With its liberalism comes a dose of sophistication and some will say detachment, and Tel Aviv is often dubbed \"The Bubble\" or \"Medinat Tel Aviv\" (\"The State of Tel Aviv\") by residents and non-residents alike. Some ultra-Orthodox Israelis have even dubbed the city a modern day \"Sodom and Gomorrah\", due to its hedonistic lifestyle.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Ben Gurion Airport "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ben Gurion Tel Aviv by David Shankbone.JPG"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Most international visitors to Israel pass through the Arrivals hall at Ben Gurion Airport"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Tel Aviv Shalom Railway Station 01.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Tel Aviv HaShalom Railway Station"]]},"\n\nTel Aviv's (and Israel's) main entry point for the international traveler is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.iaa.gov.il\/Rashat\/en-US\/Airports\/BenGurion\/ Ben Gurion International Airport"]}]}," (referred to by its Hebrew initials ",{"type":"''","value":["Natbag"]}," by locals). The airport comprises all the usual amenities expected from a first class airport and contains one of the world's largest duty-free shopping malls for an airport of its size. The airport is the hub for a number of airlines, most notably El Al. It's also one of the most secure airports in the world, given its location.\n\nEven though the airport is called ",{"type":"'''","value":["TLV"]}," it's not actually in Tel Aviv, but rather 15km away in the town of Lod. A further 20 minute drive is needed to get to Tel Aviv. This trip can be done by train, or taxi from Ben Gurion airport. There is no direct bus or sherut taxi to Tel Aviv from Ben Gurion, although traveling by bus is possible.\n\n;By train: The airport train station is easily accessible at the lower level on Terminal 3 (one level below the arrivals hall). It offers good connection to many parts of the country, including the city of Tel Aviv, with a single-ride ticket to the city for only 16 NIS (roughly $4.6 US). Buy a ticket from the cashier or from an automatic machine, and use it to enter the platform area. Keep the ticket for use to exit the electronic gate at your arrival station. The train service operates around the clock on weekdays, with 3 trains per hour most of the day and one per hour at night. On weekends and Jewish holidays, from Friday afternoon till Saturday evenings, it doesn't operate (As of May 2014, the last departure from the airport on Friday is at 15:05, the first departure on Saturday at 21:28. During winter time trains start 2 hours earlier on Saturdays). Trains stop at all four Tel Aviv stations, with the exception of late night trains that stop only at Tel Aviv Merkaz\/Savidor station. The stations are, in order of arrival from the airport: Tel Aviv HaHagana (8 minutes travel), Tel Aviv HaShalom (13 minutes), Tel Aviv Merkaz\/Savidor (18 minutes), Tel Aviv University (25 minutes). For most travelers, HaShalom or Merkaz\/Savidor would be the place to disembark. Most stations are suitable for non-Hebrew speakers, nonetheless, passengers will often be glad to assist.\n\n;By taxi: Working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, this is the most comfortable and expensive way to reach the city center, with a typical ride price of around 120 NIS (circa $35 US). If you travel with a friend or two, it can be a good idea to share a taxi. It is not inappropriate to sit in the front seat in taxis in Israel. It is obligatory by law to use the taxi meter, unless agreed otherwise by the passenger and driver, and a typical ride to the city center should not take more than 15–20 minutes, without heavy traffic. Be sure not to accept fix-priced rides with taxi drivers unless you're sure of what you are doing; you will usually end up paying more than you could have had you asked to use the meter.\n\n;By bus: This method and requires a connection and can often be more expensive than the train (depending on the exact destination and having a Rav-Kav public transportation card). It is not recommended to visitors without a command of Hebrew and a basic understanding of Israel's bus system. Egged's Line 5 shuttles passengers between the airport's two terminals, El Al Junction, and Airport City (a nearby business and industrial area). To get to Tel Aviv, the bus needs to be taken to El Al Junction and from there multiple lines travel to Tel Aviv. The last bus leaves the airport at 21:55 and in the opposite direction from El Al Junction—at 21:15 (estimated). When going to the airport, one needs to ask the driver for a ticket that includes access to Line 5 in order to avoid paying an extra fare for that line.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Sde Dov "]},"\nTel Aviv has another airport, ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.iaa.gov.il\/Rashat\/en-US\/Airports\/SdeDov\/ Sde Dov"]}]}," (SDV).

The city is easily accessible from Ben Gurion Airport via the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv freeway (freeway 1), from the north by Tel Aviv-Haifa freeway (freeway 2), as well as from Beer-Sheva and the southern parts of the country (freeways 4 and 20). Freeways' speed limit varies between 90km\/h and 100km\/h. On other intercity roads the limit is 80km\/h. On urban roads the default speed limit is 50km\/h.\n\nThe city is divided west-east by the Ayalon Freeway (freeway 20), which is the main artery of the city. It is best to avoid commuter traffic in and out of Tel Aviv and its surrounding cities during rush hours (Sunday to Thursday, 7:00–9:00 and 17:00–19:00); especially to be avoided is the entrance to Tel Aviv via Ayalon Freeway in morning rush hour, as it is one of the most busy freeways in the world. Also, it is important to note that Israeli drivers are considered aggressive in comparison to their Western European or North American counterparts. Signage is in English, Hebrew and Arabic. Navigation is difficult without GPS, and parking is expensive. If possible, avoid using a private car in Tel Aviv and use public transportation.\n   \nIsraeli highway police are strict and speed limits and driving laws are strictly enforced. All in all, driving conditions in Israel are much better than in the rest of the Middle East.\n\nParking in Tel Aviv is very hard to find, and proves to be a challenge even for the locals. Parking lots are available, but expensive (usually around 25-30 NIS an hour during the day), and can also be full around busier times (i.e., a parking in a central area could be full on a Friday night, when everybody in the area goes out to eat and drink in the city). Parking in the street (if you can find one) is allowed where there is no marking (grey) for free, where there is blue and white marking (\"kachol-lavan\") for an hourly fee (cheaper than lots) generally between 9:00-19:00 (street signs indicating that are usually just in Hebrew), and there are usually no parking meters, meaning you need to get parking cards to put in your window in advance (usually in a kiosk). Also, some areas of blue-white are reserved for locals with a zone sticker at certain times of day (mostly 17:00 to 09:00). It is forbidden to park where there are red and white or red and yellow markings, though sometimes only in certain hours, as indicated by signs (but those are usually in Hebrew only as well). The inspectors in Tel Aviv are everywhere and merciless, beware as you can get a fine of 100-500 NIS! There are generally more parking spaces in the south and the north (north of the Yarkon river that is) than there are in the center. As parking is Tel-Aviv is a rather expensive mess, it is advisable to avoid coming into the city with a car.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["New Central Bus Station"]}," in southern Tel Aviv (\"Tahana Merkazit\") offers routes servicing most locations in Israel. It is located within a short walking distance of the HaHaganah Train Station. The building, which is a combination of shopping mall and bus terminal, is more than a bit confusing - in fact, it is almost unmanageable for the infrequent visitor; tourists might want to avoid it and instead take buses destined for the 2000 Bus Terminal (see below). Nevertheless, most inter-city bus lines depart from platforms on the north wing of 6th floor, except for buses to Galilee (Afula, Nazareth, Tiberias, Kiryat Shmona etc.) which are on the south wing on 7th floor (accessible by escalator from 6th floor). Most urban lines to Tel Aviv and its suburbs are on the north wing on 7th floor (which isn't connected to the south wing of the same floor), with several lines on 4th floor which is actually at street level (those are popular city lines no. 4&5, and 44&46 to Bat Yam via Yafo).\n\nTo get to Ben Yehuda St. from the Central Bus Station, head to the 4th floor and catch line number 4.  The fare is 6 shekels (Feb. 2011).  Get off at the intersection of Allenby and Ben Yehuda to find a slew of hotels including the Sky and Momos hostels.  A good marker to find your bearings is the Mercure hotel (big lit up sign) on Ben Yehuda, get off around there.\n\nThe Egged bus #405 from Jerusalem leaves about every 20 minutes, starting at 5:50AM and ending at 23:45 PM, from Jerusalem CBS and arrives at Tel Aviv CBS. It takes 56 minutes and the fare is 20 NIS (Dec 2011). Bus #480 leaves about every 10 minutes, starting at 5:45AM with the last bus at 23:45 PM, for Arlozorov. It takes 1 hour and costs 20 NIS (Dec 2011).\n\nSeveral urban lines stop outside the station building on Levinski street (north side of the station), and some others a block away to the west on Har Zion street. Sherut taxis depart from Tzemach David street outside the east side of the station.\n\nCheck the electronic boards in departure halls for info on destinations, platforms and coming-up departures. If this doesn't help, ask at the information booths. For most intercity and some suburban lines you should go to Egged booth on 6th floor. Metropoline, a company which operates service to Beer Sheva (and destinations enroute), also has an info booth on that floor (on the right from Egged booth).\nFor most bus lines within the metropolitan area of Tel Aviv you should go to the Dan info booth on 7th floor (they also handle info on lines operated by Kavim).\n\nSeveral intercity and many metropolitan destinations are also served from the more user-friendly ",{"type":"'''","value":["2000 Bus Terminal"]}," (AKA ",{"type":"'''","value":["Arlozorov terminal"]},"), next to Tel Aviv Merkaz\/Savidor Train Station. It is a good place to make connections between train and bus, and there are information desks. North-bound buses stop at Namir Road alongside this terminal, but at peak times they might be full when they get there.\nMost south-bound buses stop at Holon Junction. The above warning is also valid there.\n\nIn general, buses follow the Fourth Commandment (\"Remember the Sabbath day\"), stopping on Friday afternoon, and only resuming service Saturday after sunset. Some services, however, may start earlier on Saturday afternoon. Minor services may not resume until Sunday morning. \nTickets can be bought from the driver, or from the ticket counters in the main stations.

A new high-speed line between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem is currently being constructed, with eventual travel time of only 28 minutes.\n\nTrains do tend to be crowded during rush hours, especially on Sunday morning, when soldiers return to their bases and students to their universities. Train service also stops on Friday afternoons, and resumes on Saturdays after sunset, in observance of the Jewish Sabbath (Shabbat).\n\nTel Aviv has four train stations, all along the Ayalon highway.

These minibuses run about the same route as #5 and #4 buses. They cost about the same as the bus, and they run on Shabbat too. You pay when you have found your seat, by passing the fare to the man next to you who will pass it along to the driver. If you sit up front be prepared to pass money to the driver and the change back to the passenger.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nYou can hail a taxi (\"mo-NIT\", מונית) in the street or call one (with extra surcharge). Taxis are obliged to give you a metered ride unless you settle for a price, so insist that the driver use the meter (\"mo-NEH\" in Hebrew, pronounced like the painter \"Monet\"), unless you are sure what the price to your destination should be. And no, the meter is never broken. A local ride without meter should be 20-30 NIS in the downtown core, and up to 50 or 60 to the immediate suburbs. If you go for a price fixed in advance, haggle with your driver a bit, you can generally knock a few shekels off the price. Cutting a deal in advance is especially recommended on Friday night and Saturday, when there is a surcharge. Plus, if you get stuck in Tel Aviv's notorious traffic, you won't sit there watching your money tick away.

These figures are also uploaded to the meter, and when coaxed, the driver will have to check his municipality code list and check the official fare. Note that these lists are only available in Hebrew, so check these prices in advance with the assistance of a Hebrew speaker.\n\nIn addition to normal (called \"special\") taxis, there are 6-12 person van-sized taxis that supplement some bus routes (\"sheh-ROOT\"). This alternative is often faster, slightly cheaper, and more frequent than taking a bus, and they operate 7 days a week. If requested, the driver will stop outside the designated bus stops.\nSuch service is available on bus routes no. 4, 5 (but note that these taxis don't reach the train station), 16, 51 and 66.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nGiven Tel Aviv's flat and coastal geography, mild weather, and a growing number of bicycle paths throughout the city - bicycle travel in Tel Aviv is an ideal way to get around.

People from all the surrounding region come to Tel Aviv to have a drink or a party so on weekends traffic is hectic at late hours and finding a parking spot is somewhere between hard and impossible (so sticking to cabs is not a bad idea).

Espresso-bar, Cafeneto, Café-café and arcaffé are some of the local chain-cafés. Aroma's the biggest among them. Feel free to spend hours in a coffee shop - no one will slap the check on your table or require you to order more stuff.\n\nBohemian 'Puah' (located in the Jaffa flea market), Café Noah, Chic 'Le Central' (Rothschild Av.), and 'Tolaat Sfarim' (Rabin Sq.) are recommended for their very distinctive and Israeli café-drinking experience.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["movetodistrict"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:PikiWiki Israel 8725 Cities in Israel.jpg"],["thumb"],["Hotels on the beachline of Tel Aviv"]]},"\nTel Aviv has a wide variety of accommodation options, from camping and backpacker hostels, boutique hotels, right up to luxury 5-star hotels.

The usual warnings regarding being alert for bomb threats also pertain to Tel Aviv - beware of suspicious packages in public places (though don't over panic), and suspicious behaviour on the part of people around you; if in doubt, report it! The local police are generally very friendly and many of the law-enforcers can speak understandable English. Also be aware of pickpockets, like in every big city, mostly in HaCarmel Market, Nachlat Binyamin market, the old and new central bus stations, the beach promenade and all of Jaffa and the flea market area. Nevertheless, regular crime rates are much lower in Tel Aviv (and in all of Israel) than in most other cities of similar size.\n\nSecurity control checks are a necessary annoyance when entering shopping malls, markets the central bus station, and most hotels, cafes and restaurant. You are frequently requested to let the guards look into your bag - this is a fairly common procedure. It is best not to find it offensive or intrusive, and this check shouldn't take more than 20 seconds and end with a smile and a green light. \nThanking a security guard for inspecting your bags will make things easier the next time they see you.\n\nIt is also best advised to carry some sort of identification documents on you at all times. Policeman may stop and ask you for identification.\n\nGiven the amount of security checkpoints at commercial premises, the presence of military facilities and decent police patrolling, firearms carried in public by both servicemen and civilians are such an everyday occurrence that most people don't even notice them. Soldiers and home guard volunteers are required to keep their weapons with them at all times, so it is not unusual to see what appears to be a group of high school students, dressed like any other high schools students out on the weekend, all carrying weapons.\n\nAs buses are the best (some might say the only) way to tour the city, it is advised not to think twice before using them. Despite their reputation as \"terrorism targets\", the city buses remain a very safe way to travel, where reality is far different than the image most tourists would have on them. They are safe at all times of day and night, frequent, cheap, reliable and easy to handle. You can always approach the driver with any relevant question and the passengers are usually keen to assist tourists.\n\nAlthough street crime is rare all around Tel Aviv, it would be best advised to avoid walking parks alone at night, or wandering alone in the southern neighbourhoods, which are a bit more rugged (south of Salame\/Eilat Street - except Florentin) late at night. If necessary, a companion would be a good idea.\n\nWhen going for a swim in the Mediterranean, stick to the patrolled beaches with lifeguards, marked with flags and signs - every year people drown off the Tel Aviv coast when strong currents get them into difficulties. Also, at the beginning of the summer, keep an eye out for jellyfish (called ",{"type":"''","value":["meduza"]}," in Hebrew, ",{"type":"''","value":["medusot"]}," is plural). Remember that during the months of winter, though the weather may allow a bathe, the lifeguard service is inactive (Official bathing season begins on April 18th and ends late in October).\n\nBe mindful that Tel Aviv has hot and long summers so be sure to drink a lot of water even if you don't feel thirsty and use lots of sunscreen.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Israeli Coastal Plain"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["32.08032"],["34.78061"],["zoom=15"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Tel Aviv"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Tel Aviv"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Middle East\/Israel\/Localities\/Tel Aviv\/"]]}]
