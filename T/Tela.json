Tela has been slowly but surely working its way to becoming an important beach destination.\n\nTela is located in a region inhabited by the afro-caribe communities called the Garifuna. The Garifuna live on communally owned land around the Tela area and have their own distinct language and culture.\n\nTela has been the site of a pilot program aimed to create the Tourist Police. The result has been outstanding, with a force of 20 bilingual, friendly tourist police officers. Statistics show that there has been absolutely no crime incidents against tourists in Tela for several years now.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nLocated less than 90 km east of San Pedro Sula's International airport, and connected by an excellent paved highway, Tela is very easily reached from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Pedro Sula"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["El Progreso"]]},". If you are driving your own car, the driving time is under one hour from San Pedro Sula. If you are taking the public bus your best option would be to choose Hedman Alas, a first class service coach operator that has non stop service from San Pedro Sula to Tela; otherwise, make sure that you take one of the direct non stop buses to La Ceiba, and let the driver know you wish to get off at the entrance to Tela. From this point, you can easily catch a taxi to take you to the beaches, that have become Tela's main attraction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nOnce in Tela, like in  most Honduran cities, the Taxi services will provide a reliable way to get around. Also Tela is a great place to walk around and explore the beach and downtown areas.yaaa\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Museo Garifuna"]},", 8 Calle NE, near the Rio Tela.

A rail service from the interior of the country brought produce to Tela to be shipped to the United States. Today the pier and train station that were central to that trade have been abandoned. They are within 100 yards of the bridge in downtown Tela and are a great destination for any avid photographer. The pier is also a great adventure (not for small children). There you can see local fisherman trying there luck at the end of the pier. The best time to go is usually a weekend as the pier becomes a gathering point for many people, especially at sunset when the view is extraordinary."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Maya Vista Hotel"]},".

Tela has a beautiful coastline, with tall palms, white sand, and exceedingly warm water. Make sure your belongings are watched at all times--either by you or a friend or family member--as unattended items can be taken by passing thieves. On the whole however, the beach experience is wonderful, and not to be missed.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Triunfo de la Cruz"]},". For those looking for an off-the-beaten-path experience in Tela, a trip to the Garifuna community of Triunfo de la Cruz is a necessity. Located just a few miles up the beach from Tela, the area has not been invaded by the hotel industries. Small beach restaurants often have changing cabins, showers and beach shacks for tourists to relax. Some will even supply you with hammocks for your day of relaxation. A bus from the center bus station or a taxi are your best way to get to this area. Walking is not recommended.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nTela's Garifuna community provides some of the best items to purchase in Tela. Strolling along the beach area, tourists will surely find people selling their hand made crafts and jewelry. Shell and shark tooth jewelry, coconut shell jewelry, and the more common hand woven jewelry, are the most prevalent items being sold.\n\nA great purchase is the coconut bread or coconut candy (called 'tabla'). Women can be found carrying large buckets on their heads, which often contain the delicious baked goods.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nOne of the best restaurants in the area is a small pizza place right near the oceanfront bridge in downtown Tela. A new patio out back of the restaurant is right on an inner-coastal waterway, which enhance the dining experience. It also has a play area and swings for those traveling with young children. The pizza is affordable and delicious.\n\nA trip to Tela can not be completed with out trying the fresh seafood of the region. Sopa de Caracol (conch soup) and sopa de jaiba (crab soup) are well know treats in local restaurants. Locals have their opinions about which seafood restaurant is better, but they are not always the same. The people of Tela are very helpful (and use to wondering tourists) if you would like a recommendation.\n\nMost hotels have their own restaurants, often inside of a secure compound for those that do not wish to walk around outside of the security of their hotels.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nFor the brave tourist, the Garifuna community will be happy share their homemade brew called Gifi (a coconut liquor).\n\nFor the more traditional experience, the beach front offers several bars.\nIn addition most restaurants will have local beers and mixed drinks.\n\nFor those looking for a non-alcoholic beverage, a fresh, cold coconut will surely hit the spot. While at the main beach areas, someone will surely find you at some point and offer you a fresh coconut to drink from. It is part of the Tela experience and should at least be tried before leaving.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Hotel La Ensenada Beach Resort & Convention Center"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Hotel Bertha"]}," is a budget hotel.
