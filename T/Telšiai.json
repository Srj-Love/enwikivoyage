A legend has it that a Knight named Džiugas founded the city. Telšiai was first mentioned in written sources around 1450. During the November Uprising in 1831 Telšiai became a sanctuary for Polish–Lithuanian partisans fighting the Russians.\n\nDuring the years of Lithuanian independence, 1918 to 1940, Telšiai grew rapidly. Several girls' and boys' high schools, a crafts school and a teacher's seminary were founded. The Alka museum was built, and several cultural societies were operated.\n\nDuring the first Soviet occupation, as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Telšiai became infamous for the nearby Rainiai massacre, the mass murder of 76 Lithuanian political prisoners perpetrated by the Red Army during the night of June 24–25, 1941.\n\nPresent day architectural monuments include Telšiai Cathedral. Telšiai has a rare, surviving wooden synagogue.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Samogitia Tourism Information Center"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.telsiaitic.lt\/1504\/about-us.html"],["email="],["address=Turgaus a. 21"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+370 444 53010"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTelšiai is small enough to be covered by foot.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:BZN Telsiai church 2 front.jpg"],["thumb"],["Church of The Assumption"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Telsiai cerkve.JPG"],["thumb"],["Orthodox Church of St. Nicolaus"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Telsiai nakti.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Katedros square at night with a view to fountain"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Žemaičių muziejaus „Alka“"],["url=http:\/\/zam.mch.mii.lt\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Adults:LTL6 , Pupils, Students and OAP LTL3"],["content=The museum contains collections of archaeological finds, numismatics, exhibits related to history and nature of the Žemaitija area and fine art."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Old Town of Telšiai"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The beautiful Old Town of Telšiai represents an urban monument.
