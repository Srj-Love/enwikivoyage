[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.temiskamingshores.ca\/ Temiskaming Shores"]}]}," is a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Ontario"]]},".\n\nThe city of Temiskaming Shores encompasses the towns of Dymond, Haileybury, and New Liskeard.  Although a city in name, it is actually quite small (population just over 10,000.)  It is, however, the biggest community in the region, with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Bay"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Timmins"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rouyn-Noranda"]]}," being the closest cities, all well over 100 km away. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nHighway 65 runs west from the Quebec border, through Dymond and on towards Elk Lake and Matachewan.  Most will come in through Highway 11 (Trans-Canada), from the south (North Bay) or north (Timmins, Cochrane.)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nHaileybury and New Liskeard are roughly 8 km apart, so a motor vehicle is key.  The Tri-Town Transit bus service connects the two, hourly on weekdays, every 2 hours Saturdays, and no service Sundays and holidays.  The transit buses, unlike any other, are repainted schoolbuses.  This makes for a *very* rough, unenjoyable ride.  $2.50 fare.  The long distance between destinations makes taxis an expensive alternative.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Devil's Rock"]}," - Large rock formation jutting out over Lake Temiskaming on the deepest part of the lake, located close to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bucke Park"]]}," and other campgrounds. If you are wanting a good view of the lake and surrounding area, its a must-see."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Burnt Island"]}," - Located in the middle of Lake Temiskaming the island was at one time home to a few farms, but most of which have since been abandoned. Perhaps not the most outstanding tourist destination, it still makes a good boat trip in summer, or a trek across the frozen lake in the winter. "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Haileybury Heritage Museum"]}," - Maintained by Chris Oslund, the museum contains an extensive collection of historical objects in relation to the town including old street cars which used to run in between Haileybury and Cobalt. Visitors will find out many interesting facts about Haileybury here such as the fact that it was the former home of the Montreal Canadiens when both Haileybury and Cobalt had an NHL team."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Haileybury Beach"]}," - Alongside the waterfront in Haileybury, there is an enclosed area which includes a layout of docks, well sanded beach, with a giant mushroom spraying water and three parks nearby for small children, and a much larger water slide similar to those in hotels on the far side of the beach. The cost to go to the beach, and use any of the amenities is free to everyone. "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Farmer's Market"]}," - Both Haileybury and New Liskeard have Farmer's market which operate through the summer months selling whatever is in season. Despite having a shorter growing season, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Ontario"]]}," supports a substantial agricultural output and visitors should take advantage of the generous prices all to common at markets. The market in New Liskeard is by the Waterfront, as is the market in Haileybury. The one in Haileybury is contained with an elaborate clock tower building which is slightly off-center and is conveniently located directly in between the beach and the marina."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Silver Centre"]}," - The remnants of one of the original mining settlements in Northern Ontario. Highway 567 which leads there passes Silver Centre and continues on to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ragged Chutes"]]}," also a former mine site. Visitors interested in seeing old mine ruins or a real ghost town will find particular interest in this site, however also of interest is the virtually untapped natural environment which one can go see at their own pace at any time. Currently there are some logging operations on going in the region, and in the winter the road is poor quality at best."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["New Liskeard Arena & Waterfront"]}," - Most towns in Northern Ontario make the Arena their community center whether official or not, as is the case for Haileybury, New Liskeard and Dymond. The nearest to professional hockey to be seen played in Temiskaming can be witnessed at the New Liskeard arena. Events such and commemorative matches are fairly frequent so it is good to find out in advance what is going on at the arena when you plan to travel. "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Empire Theatre"]}," - Most people accustomed to the conventional multiplex cinemas of larger urban centers will find the theatre located in downtown New Liskeard a bit of an oddity. However, it makes for an interesting activity to break up the itinerary. Usually the theatre plays contemporary films, however it also unveils local films as well, and in the summer it holds over certain films and is capable of reducing ticket costs on both old and new releases to a toonie matinee, with the inclusion of a free drink."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Bikers' Reunion"],["url=http:\/\/www.bikersreunion.ca\/node"],["email="],["address=Temiskaming Shores\/New Liskeard"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Highway 11 100 milles North of North Bay"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A massive Biker get-together on the first weekend of July each year.
