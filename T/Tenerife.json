On the south side there is consistent summer, little to no wind, and pretty much perfect beach-weather for much of the year though there have been rare instances of cool to cold weather in the Jan-Feb period. Also expect some very wet days for that time of year though most days will still be sunny. There are plenty of hotels, activities and British food and drink.\n\nOn the north side of the island you will find more green and vibrant local culture. There is a more Spanish year-round springtime feel. The weather fluctuates a bit more here, but is also mostly pleasant though not as hot as the south.  \n\nIn between the north and south of the island sits Spain's tallest peak, the barely dormant volcano El Teide (3718m above sea level). Tours previously allowed people into the crater, but tourists are no longer allowed into the crater for safety reasons. \n\nThe local currency is the Euro and most places accept credit or debit cards, which require a chip and PIN.

Return ticket is valid for 1 hour, if you miss it you will have to pay additional 12.50€ to go back down (however this limitation does not seem to be enforced very strictly).  To climb to the summit (the uppermost 168 m) special permission is essential by request to the National Park Office in Santa Cruz.  From the top there is an amazing view all over the island.\n\nThe ascent by foot starts at the base of the “Montaña Blanca”, at an altitude of 2200 m (very limited parking).  Don't underestimate the short walk as the gradient and low oxygen levels make it challenging even for experienced walkers.  After a relatively gentle start up a 4x4 track for around 4 km, you begin the steep and spectacular climb, ascending 530 m in just over 1.5 km, when you will reach the recently rebuilt Altavista Refuge (3270 m).  This offers climbers a bed for a maximum of a night and kitchen facilities.  After a further kilometre and 250 m ascent, the path joins another leading to La Fortaleza viewpoint, which follows the contour around El Teidi to the cable lift.  If required for descent, always check if the cable lift is operational before you set off, as it does not run in poor weather conditions and closes without warning.  You should allow 6-8 hours for an ascent and descent on foot.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["WARNING:"]}," At 3718 m (12,198 ft) El Teide is the highest mountain in Spain.

At the summit, strong winds are not uncommon which significantly reduces temperatures.  Irrespective of temperatures on the beaches, a trip to Teide (or even just the National Park) can be very cold, with snow at the peak common until typically March\/April on average.
