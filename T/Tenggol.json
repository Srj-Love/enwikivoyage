To Dive in Tenggol, it is generally preferred that a diver be advance certified, as most of the popular dive sites are deeper with current. Divers can enjoy clear warm water from the south between the months of March to October. By saying that, one does not mean these dive sites are not divable by open water certified divers. Other than a few, most dive sites do provide great shallow dives with beautiful coral and plenty of marine life with a depth shallower than 60ft\/ 18m. All divers need is to dive with a qualified Dive Master or Instructor that know the local conditions well, for safe entry and exit.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Mr Dive Malaysia"],["url=http:\/\/www.mrdivemalaysia.com"],["email="],["address=Tenggol Island Beach Resort"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=PADI courses with Australian instructors."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Scuba Explorers"],["url=http:\/\/www.scubaexplorers.com.my"],["email="],["address=Tenggol Island Beach Resort & Tenggol Resort"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=NAUI Pro scuba center, dive services by qualified dive masters and dive instructors, for beginners to dive masters.
