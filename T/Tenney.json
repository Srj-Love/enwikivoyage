[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tenney"]}," is a city with a population of six, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wilkin County"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northwestern Minnesota"]]},". Tenney bills itself as the smallest statutory city in America. It is a fully incorporated municipality which levies taxes on its residents and nonresident landowners.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThe city of Tenney was named for the owner of its townsite, lumberman John P. Tenney, because of his willingness to give land to the railroad which came through in 1885. The first house was built by his son-in-law, Fred Maechler. The post office was established in 1887, and the city was incorporated on November 30, 1901. At this time the land was surveyed and the original plat was approved. The city originally encompassed four square miles, but it never grew enough to meet its boundaries, so in 1916 the farmers petitioned their land from the city, and their request was granted. According to an unpublished town history written in the mid 1980s, the city's population peaked at about 200 in 1910. Before 1910 the city boasted a church, three grain elevators, a hardware store, two mercantile stores, a butcher shop, bank, machine shop, implement shop, blacksmith shop, pool hall, lumberyard, and a hotel, which also housed the barber shop, saloon, and post office. In 1909 a small post office building was erected and used until 1952, when Leonard Hardie became postmaster and moved the post office to the general store. Electricity arrived in Tenney in 1914, through a franchise granted to Ottertail Power Company. After 1910 a steady population decline was driven by the lack of significant population in outlying areas, migration to larger urban centers, and the absence of dynamic economic factors to generate wealth. US Census bureau data indicates that the population fell to 102 in 1920, 89 in 1930, 89 in 1940, 62 in 1950, 35 in 1960 and 24 in 1970. As local establishments burned down or went out of business they were not replaced, and finally the post office was discontinued in 1980 when the population was pegged at 19 by the census bureau. Today the only remaining business in town is the elevator. The only commercial building remaining on the main drag is the former James Bigsby general store, later the G.A. Klugman general store, which is not currently open but which (as of May 2007) is being renovated and is slated to open as a tavern\/restaurant in September 2007.\n\nThe population bottomed out at 2 sometime after the 2000 census, but due to the energetic efforts of current residents, the population has again risen to six, and efforts to attract more residents are ongoing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nTenney is situated about a mile east of the intersection of US Highway 75 and Minnesota Highway 55.\n\nInterstate 29 runs about fifteen miles to the west, across the border in North Dakota.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nTenney has only five streets; three running north-south and two running east-west.  The town is easily walkable.  The downtown \"business district\" is confined to one street, one block long.
