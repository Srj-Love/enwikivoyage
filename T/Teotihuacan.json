The name is also used to refer to the civilization this city dominated, which at its greatest extent included most of Mesoamerica.\n\nConstruction of Teotihuacán commenced around 300 BC, with the Pyramid of the Sun built by 150 BC. 150–450 AD.\n\nIt is said that the descendents of this city abandoned this city and relocated in ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tenochtitlan Tenochtitlan"]}," because it was thought to be a more sacred location.\n\nA lot of artifacts have wisely been moved to National Anthropological Museum, in Mexico City.\nElevation: 2,300m\/7482f\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:View from Pyramid of Sun.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["Temple of the Moon as seen from Temple of Sun"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By car (or taxi)"]}," - it takes about 45 minutes from the Mexico City, city center if you use the toll highway. It takes much longer, but more interesting, if you use the old free road. There is a small fee for parking at the site. A taxi may be prohibitively expensive, though sometimes \"tours\" with a car and driver\/guide can be arranged for a reasonable fee if you want the convenience.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By bus"]}," - Buses to Teotihuacán leave from Mexico City about every half hour from two locations:  Terminal Autobuses del Norte (outside Autobuses del Norte Metro station, Line 5) or from outside the Potrero Metro station (Line 3).  A one-way ticket will cost $35 pesos.  From Terminal del Norte, walk towards Gate 8.  There is a ticket booth almost at the end of the concourse.  Check that your bus goes to the site entrance of ",{"type":"''","value":["Teotihuacán ruinas"]}," and not just to the town of San Juan Teotihuacán nearby.

The trip will take around an hour, and the buses run until about 6pm -- check the last departure before you leave.
