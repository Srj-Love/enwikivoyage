The rolling stock is new, but the stations are dilapidated and, with the exception of two stations (Engenheiro\/Bandeira and Frei Serafim), are nowhere near where you would travel in Teresina as a visitor or even as a member of the upper poor class or higher. Most of the stations on the east side of the Poti River are on narrow, dead end streets in poor neighborhoods with no commerce nearby and no bus terminals. Station names can be a point of confusion for both locals and visitors. The west side terminus is referred to as \"Bandeira\" station, yet the station's official name is \"Engenheiro Alberto Tavares Silva.\" \"Novo Horizonte\" is somtimes referred to as \"Parque Ideal.\" Other stations on the east side also vary in name and have no signage to indicate which station you are at (e.g., Mercado, Itararé, Novo Horizonte).\n\nApproximately 8,000 people ride the metro per day (225,000 ride buses per day). Although it was started in 1991 around the same time as larger and more successful metro systems in central and southern Brazil, the Metro appears to be more of a vanity project for local politicians than a useful transportation alternative to buses.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Benedict the Moore.jpg"],["thumb"],["Benedict the Moore Church, in Teresina"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ponte do Sesquicentenário.jpg"],["thumb"],["Lookout tower at the Sesquicentennial Bridge"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Benedict the Moore Church"],["alt=Igreja São Benedito"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=João Isidoro França Sesquicentennial Cable Suspension Bridge (lookout tower)"],["url=http:\/\/www.turismoteresina.com\/guias\/atrativos-turisticos\/complexo-turistico-mirante-ponte-estaiada-149.html"],["email="],["address=Av.
