It joined Canada's National park system in 1957. It is Canada's most easterly national park and, like all of Canada's national park System, Terra Nova is dedicated to protecting and celebrating the beauty and variety of the land. Terra Nova is an excellent way to experience the nature, discovery and adventure of eastern Newfoundland. It is a place where sheltered Atlantic fiords stretch inland to touch the boreal landscape. \n\nThe Terra Nova region is rich in natural resources, such as fish and sea mammals. These resources have attracted people to the Terra Nova area for at least 5,000 years. Prehistoric peoples and European settlers depended on the rich resources of the sea and land, as do many people in the region today.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe first settlers in Canada originally landed at Alexander Bay; what is now the coast of Terra Nova National Park.\n\nmountains\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nMoose, bear, fox, lynx, and beaver are commonly found, as are many wildflowers, conifers, and deciduous trees.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Air"]},"\n\nTerra Nova National Park is:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Approximately 220km west of ",{"type":"'''","value":["St. John's International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. John's"]]},") on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trans-Canada Highway"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Approximately 67km east of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gander International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gander"]]},") on the Trans-Canada Highway"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The estuary at Newman Sound."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" A show at the Newman Sound Amphitheatre."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The interpretive video at the Marine Interpretation Centre"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" View Bonavista Bay from the Blue Hill Autotrail"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Walk the Coastal Train from Newman Sound to Headquarters Wharf."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Kayak the sheltered waters of Newman Sound."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Take a boat tour to view bald eagles, whales, icebergs."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Do the interactive exhibits at the Marine Interpretation Centre, Salton's."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Golf at Twin River's Golf Course."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Convenience Store"]},", Newman Sound"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Starfish Eatery"]}," at the Marine Interpretation Centre"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Snacks available at Sandy Pond, in the park"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Newman Sound Campground"]}," -- 400 serviced and unserviced wooded campsites."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Malady Head Campground"]}," -- 60 unserviced wooded campsites with firepits."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Backcountry Camping"]},"-- unserviced back country lots thought the park."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Charlottetown (Newfoundland)"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastport Peninsula"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glovertown"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Blandford"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=TCH 1.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gander"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glovertown"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. John's"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Clarenville"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["48.530556"],["-53.928056"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Eastern Newfoundland"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia: Terra Nova National Park"]]}]
