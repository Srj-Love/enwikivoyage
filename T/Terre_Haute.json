The city grew up primarily around industry and river traffic on the Wabash River.  The growth of the railroads and a short-lived oil boom contributed to the city's prosperity, but the decline of both, along with the Depression, resulted in the city becoming a model of Midwestern urban decay up through 1980s.  Recent mayors have worked hard to reverse this image, and have begun making gains in turning the city back around.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist Information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Terre Haute Convention & Visitors Bureau."]}," 643 Wabash Avenue, Terre Haute. +1 812 234-5555 or (800) 366-3043. 24-hour information line: +1 812 238-TALK."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nTerre Haute is served by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.huf.com\/ Terre Haute International Airport"]},", but there have not been any commericial flights from there since 1999.

Rental car services to Terre Haute are available at the airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThere are three main highways which run through the city: Interstate 70 running east to west through the south of the city (near Honey Creek Mall); U.S. 41 (known locally as Third Street) oriented north-south; and U.S. 40 (also known as Wabash Avenue) as the road which separates the north and south parts of the city. U.S. 40 splits near the central business district. The westbound traffic turns onto Cherry Street, and the eastbound traffic runs into Ohio Street.

Also, many people cannot manage to drive the speed limit.  Bicycling is becoming increasingly popular due to the heightened gas prices, although cyclers should use caution when riding, as bike lanes and paths are still few and far between. Sidewalks are usually the preferred paths for bikes, but some of the sidewalks on secondary roads are in poor condition.
