As the Muslim population in Macedonia began to expand in the early Ottoman period mosques, baths, and markets began to appear as early as the 15th century. Tetovo under Ottoman tutelage became an important trade center for the local farmers and craftsmen, as well as an important military fortification.

Haci Halife in the 17th century noted in his writings that Kalkandelen was expanding at an amazing rate in its lowland areas.\n\nBy the 19th century, when the population of Tetovo began to increase with settlement from the surrounding villages, the French traveler Ami Bue noted that the population had reached about 4,500 people. In 1912, due to the Balkan wars, Tetovo became a Serbian city. In World War II Tetovo was jointly ruled by Italy and its regime in Albania. The Communist Party of Macedonia, was formed on March 19th 1943 in Tetovo.\n\nToday, Tetovo is prosperous city with many private companies, stores, two universities and lots a things to see.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Railway Station"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=Boris Kidrich Street (Борис Кидрич)"],["lat=42.0073"],["long=20.9866"],["directions="],["phone="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Bus Station"],["alt=Тетово Автобуска Cтаница"],["url="],["email="],["address=Boris Kidrich Street (Борис Кидрич)"],["lat=42.01"],["long=20.99"],["directions="],["phone=+38944 339130"],["hours=24\/7"],["price="],["content=There is perfect and regular bus connection with all of the cities in Macedonia.
