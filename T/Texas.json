However, in 1836, Texas won its independence from Mexico and became the Republic of Texas. The most famous battle of the fight for independence was the stand at the Alamo. Although tragic, the sacrifice allowed the main army of Texas time enough to gather their strength and defeat the formidable Mexican army, led by General Santa Anna. Nine years later Texas agreed to be annexed by the United States and became the 28th state of the Union.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\n\nThe ethnic background of Texas is extremely diverse. Fully one-third of the population has some sort of Hispanic background. There are also many German settlements (such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fredericksburg (Texas)"],["Fredericksburg"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Braunfels"]]},"), as well as Norwegian, Polish, Czech, Swedish and French settlements. Also, a sizeable number of African-Americans (mainly in East and Southeast Texas) and Asian-Americans (often in metropolitan areas of Texas) can be found.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nTexas is a huge state and therefore experiences an extreme variety of weather. The state is very warm in the summer months, with temperatures often above 100ºF (38ºC). In West Texas and the Panhandle, summers are usually dry with fits of stormy weather.  North (Dallas\/Fort Worth region) and coastal (Houston region) areas have unstable climates (hence the oft-repeated saying about Texas weather: \"If you don't like the weather, wait 10 minutes\" – though 10 minutes later you might not like the change).\n\nThunderstorms are common, sometimes generating tornadoes and hailstorms. It is often warmer near the coast, though humidity can be unbearable in the summer. Conversely, the spring, autumn and winter are relatively pleasant for most of the state. It rarely dips below the freezing point in winter, except in the Panhandle region where the winters can get quite cold (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lubbock"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amarillo"]]}," have suffered devastating blizzards in the past), and, though it is quite rare, even points as far south as Corpus Christi and Brownsville have seen snow.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Size"]},"\n\nAgain, the sheer size of the state is not to be underestimated.

Due to the enormous amount of traffic from Mexico and Central America, Laredo is the country's largest inland port, and wait times at this and all border stations can often be tremendous. In all, Texas boasts  over 72,000 miles of state and federal highways.\n\nIf you are not a U.S. citizen and you are driving into the U.S. from Mexico, you must have a visa or valid permit beforehand, as they are not issued at the bridges across the Rio Grande.

Even so, conditions in stations and on the buses are first class.

Gas stations are numerous; however, in rural West Texas, do not press your luck.  Texan highways are often built with parallel frontage roads and turnarounds at most exits. Speed limits are very strictly enforced in rural areas of the state; Texas state troopers will pull you over for an infraction as small as five miles per hour over the speed limit, as traffic fines are often an important source of income for many smaller towns. However, when traveling through larger cities, observing the \"common speed\" of traffic around you is much safer.  The rural speed limit in Texas is generally 70 MPH, though it increases to 80 MPH on Interstates 10 and 20 in the sparsely populated far western portion of the state.\n\nOn the down side, Texas has one of America's worst traffic safety records and one of the highest number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities in America.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nTexas is home to two major airlines: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aa.com\/ American Airlines"]},", based out of Dallas-Ft.

United Airlines maintains a primary hub at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH). American and United fly to many national and international destinations.  Southwest is the no-frills discounter granddad and flies throughout Texas and most of the United States. Travel to any destination world-wide is quite painless from the larger Texas airports.  Nonstop flights to and from Houston's IAH include London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Moscow, Dubai, Doha, Buenos Aires, São Paulo, Bogota, Lagos, and Tokyo.

Again, the size of the state is startling; traveling across the width of Texas (from Orange, in the eastern extremity, near Houston, to El Paso in the western extremity) is roughly the same distance as one would encounter while traveling from El Paso to Los Angeles or from Houston to Jacksonville, Florida.

This was due to an unfortunate incident where people staying in a hotel were arrested for being intoxicated in that hotel's bar.  There has been enough negative feedback from the public regarding the TABC program that it has been suspended for review.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Texas beers"]},"\nTexas produces a number of famous beers, particularly German-style beers, which are available throughout the state and beyond. \n",{"type":"*","value":[" The ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.shiner.com\/ Spoetzl Brewer"]}]}," in Shiner is famous for producing ",{"type":"'''","value":["Shiner Bock"]},", the best selling specialty beer in the state."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Anheiser-Busch"]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Houston"]]}," brewery produces ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ziegen Bock"]},", sold only in Texas."]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Lone Star Beer"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.lonestarbeer.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Brewed in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Antonio"]]},", is billed as the \"national beer of Texas\", but is sold as far away as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York (state)"],["New York"]]}," — and reportedly even spotted in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tallinn"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Estonia"]]},"."]]}]},"There are also several important regional breweries, such as Saint Arnold and Southern Star in Houston and Real Ale near San Antonio.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Crime"]},"\n\nThe crime rate in Texas is relatively low. In the larger cities, if you stay in the tourist areas you will be generally safe (talk to your hotel concierge or manager if you aren't sure about a certain area). The rural areas have a very low crime rate. Texans have a reputation for carrying firearms or resolving disputes with gunfire, but such actions are not significantly more common here than in other parts of the US. Concerns about crime spilling over from Juarez across the border into El Paso is unjustified, as El Paso remains a very safe city. Of course, Juarez sadly remains a very unsafe city, and El Pasoans will very strongly advise that you do not cross the bridges.\n\nLaw enforcement is provided statewide. All major cities and almost all towns have a police department, and all counties maintain a sheriff's office. However, in some more sparsely populated areas of the state agencies may be more understaffed and spread out. This is especially true in West Texas, where many towns are too small to operate police departments, and county sheriff's offices may be poorly manned and spread out over enormous land areas. Just as in the rest of the United States, the number \"911\" should be called in the event of an emergency.\n\nPolicing on the state level is generally provided by the Texas Highway Patrol. This agency mainly enforces state traffic laws, but also provides more localized law enforcement services in areas like West Texas. The Texas Highway Patrol has an outstanding reputation in the United States for being extremely courteous and professional. Officers of this agency (called \"troopers\") can be easily recognized by their characteristic tan uniform and matching cowboy hat. The Texas Rangers, despite being internationally known and storied, are unlikely to be seen by the public and are not prominent in everyday police work.\n\nDespite stories of extremely harsh and brutal justice in Texas, law is executed in the Lone Star State in just as fair a manner as in any of the other forty-nine states.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Social Issues"]},"\n\nTexas is generally safe for ",{"type":"'''","value":["LGBTQ travelers"]},". Texas's law criminalizing homosexual behavior was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2003. Austin, Dallas\/Fort Worth, El Paso, Houston, and San Antonio have large and very friendly gay communities; Houston elected an openly lesbian mayor in 2009, becoming the largest US city to do so. Attitudes towards gays are more accepting in urban areas than rural areas. Texas's high rate of religious observance and strong Christian traditions influence the negative attitudes towards LGBTQ people and, in particular, public displays of homosexuality. Regardless, while isolated incidents of gay-bashing do occur, violence against gays is very rare.\n\nTexas has a very strong ",{"type":"'''","value":["gun culture"]},", owing to its rural character, strong hunting traditions, and its many US military bases. The vast majority of people who carry handguns are kind, law-abiding people who will not cause any trouble for anyone. Be aware, however, that gun politics arouses very strong emotions and opinions for many Texans, and it is best to avoid discussing the topic.\n\nTexas has very tough laws regarding ",{"type":"'''","value":["narcotics"]},". Simple possession of even small amounts of any illegal substance can cause you significant and expensive legal trouble.\n\nNear the Mexican border, it is very common to encounter CBP (Customs & Border Patrol) agents. They are generally somewhat gruff, but always professional. If you encounter a CBP roadblock while driving, relax and answer any questions calmly and honestly. The agents are looking for drug cartel members and smugglers and are unlikely to bother the average tourist.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Severe Weather"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Heat"]},"\nThe startling heat of a Texas summer is not to be underestimated. The state has experienced temperatures as high as 120ºF (49ºC), and though this extreme is rare, it is a good indicator of how hot things can get. Areas from north central Texas down to the coast also tend to experience stifling humidity during the spring and summer months, so pack accordingly with plenty of loose, light colored clothing. \n\nWestern portions of the state tend to experience higher temperatures and lower humidity. It is true that the Texas deserts are beautiful, but the heat can be dangerous without the proper precautions. Bring plenty of water and sunscreen. If you are venturing off into the desert, it might be best to do so later in the afternoon once the sun has begun to lower in the sky.

Always maintain a vigilance of any severe weather threats while traveling through or to these regions of the state during the spring and summer months. Dangerous weather conditions can arise suddenly, and if a traveler is unprepared, dire consequences may be the result. Tornadoes in this region can be exceptionally large and deadly. If there is an eminent threat of such weather, do not stay outside to take pictures. Do not try to outrun a tornado in your vehicle.
