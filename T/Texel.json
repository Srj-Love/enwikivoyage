Inland you find the fourth landscape - wetlands - with beautiful walking trails in the center west coast of the island, like ",{"type":"''","value":["The Slufter"]},". Along the wadden-coast in the east there are comparably smaller Wetlands. In the dunes, valleys like ",{"type":"''","value":["The Muy"]}," are quite popular with tourists.\n\nBoth tourists and birds are abundant. The tourists visit mostly in the summer.\n\nThe islanders call their hilly area the ",{"type":"''","value":["Hoge Berg"]}," (\"High Mountain\"). Its highest point is about 15 meters above sea level and gives a fabulous view over the island. It's not the summit of the island. The dune ",{"type":"''","value":["Loodsmansduin"]}," in the south reaches 30 meters above sea level.\n\nOriginally, the locals spoke their own dialect, known as \"Tessels\". Nowadays it's dying out and is replaced by a more Standard-Dutch tongue, although still with specific words and accents. The inhabitants have their own name for the mainland: ",{"type":"''","value":["de Overkant"]},", literally \"the Other Side\".\n\nThe official name is Texel. The x in it is normally pronounced as ",{"type":"''","value":["ss"]},", so the name sounds like \"Tessel\". In Standard-Dutch, the correct pronunciation is Tessel, but a lot of Dutchmen pronounce it with an x-sound. The locals however always pronounce it as \"Tessel\".\n\nThe following villages are on Texel:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=De Cocksdorp"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=53.156"],["long=4.872"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Den Hoorn"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=53.026"],["long=4.753"],["directions=South of island"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Leafy village with pretty rustic cottages."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=De Koog"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=53.100"],["long=4.763"],["directions=West side of island, by the beach."],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The town where the sun lovers go.
