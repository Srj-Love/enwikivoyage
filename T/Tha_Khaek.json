It is normally done in 3-4 days on a hired moped or using your own transport. It is not for the faint hearted. The condition of the roads and the driving standards make driving challenging to say the least. But once you have washed all of the thick orange dust out of your hair and clothing it is hard not to feel a great sense of achievement in having completed it.\n\nDon't attempt to do the whole loop on the bicycles you can rent, unless you are very determined.

A 7 km long underground river that can be navigated by motorized longboat with a torch. It emerges into a lush valley on the far side which previously was only accessible by foot. In the dry season you will have to get out while the boatmen drag the long boat over the shallows, so bring flip flops. The cave is in the Phou Hin Bun National Park, 2,000 kip entrance fee, 3,000 kip\/motorbike. The entrance fee for the cave itself is 5,000 kip\/person, the return trip with a longboat costs 100,000 kip\/2 people (110,000 kip in total for two persons on a boat, three people might be possible as well). The road to Konglor leads through a valley with tobacco fields. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ban Nahin"]]}," village at Rte 8, 42 km from Kong Lor, has many guest houses and motorbike rentals. There are various guest houses near Kong Lor as well and some good home stays in the village about 1 km from the cave itself (50,000 kip per person with breakfast and dinner, maximum of three people in the same house).\n\nCheck your bikes thoroughly before starting this trip, make sure the brakes and lights work and check the odometer as turnings are not necessarily signed and you want to measure the distance between junctions. If your helmet does not have a visor, sunglasses are essential as dust and insects will blind you. \n\nCarrying a spare bottle of fuel gives a sense of security and might well make your day, as there are long stretches without gas stations, and ascents might spoil average consumption. Road #1E, the section between Yommalat and Laksao (some 80 km), while very rewarding, constitutes a mere dirt track with lots of deep potholes filled with mud, especially after the local heavy rains.\n\nReasonable places for overnights on a counterclockwise roundtrip could be the Sabaidee Guesthouse in Tha Lang (after 99 km without cave watching), and maybe a homestay\/guesthouse near Konglor Cave (after another 145 km), before an early visit there and return to Thakhek (another 185 km), making it an enjoyable three-day trip.\n\nThere are a number of very informative scrapbooks filled with tips, maps and other experiences on The Loop at Travellers Lodge.\n\nIf riding a moped or bicycle isn't your style, you can still do the loop, or a portion of it, via a hired air conditioned minivan (with guide and driver) from the Tha Khaek tourist office. Through InterLao travel it is possible to book this tour beforehand, but they charge a premium for the service. The guide will bring water, assist in food purchases and show you the local sights including the waterfall above Ban Nahim. The tour can also include the Lao 'Baci' (welcome to village) ceremony. The minivan can drop you back at Tha Khaek, leave you at the intersection of Hwy 8 for a trip up to Vientiane via VIP bus or (perhaps) take you up to Vientiane (about 240 km and 1 million kip).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Eat "]},"\nA number of cafes line the riverfront road serving the usual types of basic food.\nIn the market good noodle soup and be eaten under the sheltered section towards the middle.\nPork rolls in hot baguettes can be bought as a takeaway lunch from stands near the new fountain square at the end of the main road.
