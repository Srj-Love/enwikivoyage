[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Thai"]}," (ภาษาไทย ",{"type":"''","value":["phaasǎa Thai"]},") is the official language of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]}," and the native language of the Thai people around the world.\n\nThai is member of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tai-Kadai language family"]},", just like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lao phrasebook"],["Lao"]]},", with which the language is closely related. There are several different dialects are spoken in the distinct regions of the country, namely the central, northern and southern dialects. The northeast speaks a different language, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Isaan language"]},", which is, with minor differences in vocabulary aside, virtually identical to Lao.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\n\nThai is a ",{"type":"'''","value":["tonal"]}," language with five tones: Mid, Low, Falling, High, and Rising. Meanings can change critically based on the tone, but Thais are fairly used to hearing foreigners mangle their language and can often work out the correct tone based on context. Try not to inflect your sentences; in particular, any questions should be pronounced as flat statements, without the rising intonation (\"...yes?\") typical to English questions.\n\nThe Thai written language is essentially alphabetic, but notoriously difficult to read due to a profusion of 44 consonants (many redundant), complicated tone and vowel signage around consonants and a complete lack of spaces between words.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\n\nThai has a complicated set of vowels and diphthongs that distinguishes between vowel length (short and long) and vowel position (front and back).  In Thai script, vowel signs are always written around consonants and the letter ก (",{"type":"''","value":["k"]},") is used here to demonstrate. This list follows the Royal Thai General System of Transcription (except that some long vowels are doubled).\n\n; ka กะ : like 'a' in \"car\" (short vowel)\n; kaa กา : like 'a' in \"father\" (longer than \"a\")\n; kae แก : like 'a' in \"man\" (short vowel: \"แกะ\")\n; ke เก : like 'e' in \"bed\" (short vowel: \"เกะ\")\n; ki กิ : like 'y' in \"greedy\"\n; kii กี : like 'ee' in \"see\" (longer than \"i\")\n; ko กอ : like 'o' in \"torn\" (short vowel: \"เกาะ\")\n; ko โก : like 'oa' in \"moan\" (short vowel: \"โกะ\")\n; koe เกอ : like 'i' in \"sir\" (short vowel: \"เกอะ\")\n; ku กุ : like 'oo' in \"hoop\"\n; kuu กู : like 'ue' in \"blue\" (longer than \"u\")\n; kue กือ : frontal version of \"u\" (akin to German \"ü\", French \"d",{"type":"'''","value":["u"]},"\", not found in English) (short vowel: \"กึ\")\n; kam กำ : like 'um' in \"dummy\"\n; kai ใก\/ไก : like 'i' in \"kind\"\n; kia เกีย : like 'eer' in \"beer\" (but don't pronounce \"r\")\n; kua กัว : similar to 'ou' in \"tour\" (but don't pronounce \"r\")\n; kuea เกือ : like \"ue\" followed by a short \"a\"\n; kao เกา : like 'ow' in \"cow\"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consonants"]},"\n\nThai distinguishes between ",{"type":"'''","value":["aspirated"]}," (\"with a puff of air\") and ",{"type":"'''","value":["unaspirated"]}," (\"without a puff of air\") consonants. Unaspirated consonants exist in English too, but never alone: compare the sound of 'p' in \"pot\" (aspirated) and \"spot\" (unaspirated). Many English speakers find it helpful to pronounce an imperceptible little \"m\" in front to 'stop' the puff.\n\nIn Thai romanized with the Royal Thai General System (used on Wikivoyage), the distinction is usually represented by writing aspirated consonants with \"h\" and unaspirated ones without it. In particular, \"ph\" represents a hard aspirated 'p' and ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," a soft 'f', and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phuket"]]}," is thus pronounced \"Poo-ket\". Likewise, \"th\" is a hard aspirated 't' and hence ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]}," is pronounced \"Tie-land\".\n\nOther systems of romanization may use 'bp', 'dt' and 'g' for the unaspirated sounds, and 'p', 't', and 'k' for the aspirated sounds. This is not used in this guide.\n\n; b บ : like 'b' in \"bed\"\n; bp : not used here, but in other romanizations may represent unaspirated 'p'\n; ch ฉ ช ฌ : like 'ch' in \"chop\"\n; d ฎ ด : like 'd' in \"dog\"\n; dt : not used here, but in other romanizations may represent unaspirated 't'\n; f ฝ ฟ : like 'f' in \"fun\"\n; g : not used here, but in other romanizations may represent unaspirated 'k'\n; h ห ฮ : like 'h' in \"help\"\n; j จ : like 'j' or 'dg' in \"judge\"\n; k ก : like 'k' in \"skate\" (unaspirated)\n; kh ข ฃ ค ฅ ฆ : like 'c' in \"Kate\" (aspirated)\n; l ล ฦ ฬ : like 'l' in \"love\"\n; m ม : like 'm' in \"mother\"\n; n ณ น : like 'n' in \"nice\"\n; ng ง : like 'ng' in \"sing\", but can also be used at the beginning of words\n; p ป : like 'p' in \"spit\" (unaspirated)\n; ph ผ พ ภ : like 'p' in \"pit\" (aspirated)\n; r ร ฤ : very light 'r', often pronounced as 'l' or omitted entirely\n; s ซ ศ ษ ส : like 'ss' in \"hiss\",\n; t ฏ ต : like 't' in \"stop\"\n; th ฐ ฑ ฒ ถ ท ธ : like 't' in \"top\"\n; v : not used here, but in other romanizations may represent 'w'\n; w ว : like 'w' in \"weight\"\n; y ญ ย : like 'y' in \"yes\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Grammar"]},"\nBasic Thai grammar is fairly straightforward. Word order is subject-verb-object, as in English. Nouns and verbs do not conjugate, and there are no plurals or grammatical gender. Instead, a wide array of particles and markers are employed to indicate past tense, negation, etc.\n\n: ",{"type":"''","value":["phom kin khao"]}," ผมกินข้าว\n: \"I eat rice\"\n\nAdjectives are placed after the noun, not before.\n: ",{"type":"''","value":["phom kin '"]},"khao suai''''' ผมกินข้าวสวย\n: \"I eat ",{"type":"'''","value":["rice beautiful"]},"\" (I eat white rice)\n\nThe negation marker ไม ",{"type":"''","value":["mai"]}," goes before the verb.\n: ",{"type":"''","value":["phom ",{"type":"'''","value":["mai kin"]}," khao"]}," ผมไม่กินข้าว\n: \"I ",{"type":"'''","value":["not eat"]}," rice\" (I will not eat\/am not eating rice)\n\nThe past tense marker แล้ว ",{"type":"''","value":["laew"]}," goes after the verb and its object (if any).\n: ",{"type":"''","value":["phom ",{"type":"'''","value":["kin"]}," khao '"]},"laew''''' ผมกินข้าวแล้ว\n: \"I ",{"type":"'''","value":["eat"]}," rice ",{"type":"'''","value":["already"]},"\" (I ate rice)\n\nPronouns are often omitted if it's clear from the context who is doing what.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Phrase list"]},"\nNote that that the polite suffix ครับ ",{"type":"''","value":["khráp"]}," (for men) and ค่ะ ",{"type":"''","value":["khâ"]}," (for women) can and should be attached to all phrases when talking with strangers.

This is especially prominent in lower and middle classes, but is a general trend. This can be compared to western languages, where adding \"Sir\" at the end of each sentence when speaking to somebody in authority is becoming less and less common, and already entirely removed in many languages. On another note, there is a trend among the upper and middle classes, especially among younger men, to call each other ",{"type":"''","value":["phii"]},", no matter the age difference.
