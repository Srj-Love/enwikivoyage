This is the second highest in the world. 74% of those fatalities involved \"motorized two or three wheelers\". Motorcyclists (including passengers) are required to wear crash helmets and to keep their headlights switched on at all times. Enforcement varies widely, but in tourist areas spot checks for helmets and\/or licenses are commonplace. While the fines are light (typically 400 baht) the inconvenience can be considerable as offender's vehicle and\/or driver's license is impounded until the fine is paid, and the queue at the police station can be lengthy.\n\nSome (but not all) border crossings allow motorcycles through.

Prices without insurance for a self-driven car start from around 800 baht\/day for small cars, and from as little as 600 baht\/day for open-topped Jeeps. Cars with insurance start at just under 1,000 baht\/day, and come down to around 5,600 baht\/week or 18,000 baht\/month.\n\nDriving is (usually, but not always!) on the left hand side of the road. Fuel at large petrol stations is 37-45 baht\/litre. Small kerbside vendors who pump by hand from drums and\/or pour from bottles charge a few baht more.\n\nCars can be rented without difficulty in many locations. It's worth paying a little more than the absolute minimum to use one of the international franchises (e.g. Avis, Budget, and Hertz) to minimize the risk of hassles, and to ensure that any included insurance is actually worth something.\n\nMore reputable agencies require that valid licences be produced. Foreigners who do not have a Thai driving licence ",{"type":"'''","value":["must carry a valid International Driving Permit"]},".  Even if you manage to rent a car without an IDP, not having one will invalidate the insurance and count against you in the event of an accident.\n\nA common rental scam involves the owner taking a deposit, and then later refusing to refund it in full on the basis that the customer is responsible for previous damage; the Tourist Police (dial 1155) may be able to help. Another common scam involves the owner having someone follow the rented vehicle and later \"steal\" it, using a set of spare keys. Always report thefts: a \"stolen\" vehicle may mysteriously turn up as soon as the police become involved.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:AoNang Longtails.JPG"],["thumb"],["240px"],["Long-tail boats, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ao Nang"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Krabi Province"],["Krabi"]]}]]},"\n\nOne of the Thais' many names for themselves is ",{"type":"''","value":["jao naam"]},", the Water Lords, and from the river expresses of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]}," to the fishing trawlers of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phuket"]]},", boats remain an indispensable way of getting around many parts of the country.\n\nPerhaps the most identifiably Thai boat is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["longtail boat"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["reua hang yao"]},"), a long, thin wooden boat with the propeller at the end of a long \"tail\" stretching from the boat.

The \"helpful\" driver will then offer to take the traveller to another site, such as a market or store. Travellers who accept these offers will often end up at out-of-the-way markets with outrageous prices - and no way to get back to the centre of town where they came from. Always check at the front gate of the site you're visiting to make sure it's really closed.\n\nSome tuk-tuk drivers might demand much higher price than agreed, or they might take you to a sex show, pretending they didn't understand the address (they get commissions from sex shows). For the same reason, avoid drivers who propose their services without being asked, especially near major tourist attractions.\n\nDon't buy any sightseeing tours at the airport. If you do, they will phone several times to your hotel to remind you about the tour. During the tour, you will be shortly taken to a small temple, without a guide, and then one shop after another (they get commissions). They might refuse to take you back home until you see all the shops. On your way back, they pressure you to buy more tours.\n\nEasily identified with practice, it is not uncommon in tourist areas to be approached by a clean cut, well dressed man who will often be toting a cellphone. These scammers will start up polite conversation, showing interest in the unsuspecting tourist's background, family, or itinerary. Inevitably, the conversation will drift to the meat of the scam.

The suggestion is that the visitor completes a tourism questionnaire (which includes supplying their hotel name and room number) with the incentive that they just might win a prize - the reality is that everyone gets a call to say that they are a \"winner\"; however, the prize can only be collected by attending an arduous time-share presentation. Note that the lady with the clipboard doesn't get her 30 baht if you don't attend the presentation; also that only English-speaking nationalities are targeted.\n\nA more recent serious scam involves being accused of shoplifting in the duty free shops in the Bangkok airport. This may involve accidentally straying across ill defined boundaries between shops with merchandise in hand, or being given a \"free gift\". Always get a receipt.

Warning your travel companions about this danger is also advised. In case this happens, firmly refuse to get off the bus, tell the rest of the people about the situation and immediately call the police.

As far as ascertaining the age of your partner goes, all adult Thais must carry an identity card, which will state that they were born in 2538 or earlier if they were over the age of 18 on 1 Jan 2013 (in the Thai calendar, 2013 is the year 2556).\n\nSome prostitutes are \"freelancers\", but most are employed by bars or similar businesses and if hiring a prostitute from a bar or similar business, you will have to pay a fee for the establishment called a \"bar fine\", usually 300-500 baht.  This entitles you to take them out of their place of employment. It does not pay for additional services. That is contracted separately.\n\nBar girls, go-go girls and freelancers are all professionals, who are far more likely to be interested in money you can give them than in any continuing relationship for its own sake.

Thailand has a high rate of STD infection, including HIV\/AIDS, both among the general population and among prostitutes. Condoms can be bought easily in Thailand in all convenience shops and pharmacies but may not be as safe as Western ones.\n\nTechnically, some aspects of prostitution in Thailand are illegal (e.g., soliciting, pimping), but enforcement is liberal and brothels are commonplace.

If you do take the risk and get arrested on drug-related charges, you would do well to immediately contact your embassy as a first step. The embassy usually cannot get you out of jail but can alert your home country of your arrest and can often put you in contact with a lawyer in Thailand.

Among Thais, there are strict rules of hierarchy that dictate how and when the wai should be given. In brief, inferiors salute superiors first. You should not wai service people or street vendors. The higher your hands go, the more respectful you are. You will also often see Thais doing a wai as they walk past temples and spirit houses. As a foreign visitor, you are not expected to know how to wai, nor to reciprocate when wai'd to; while you're unlikely to cause offense if you do, you may well look slightly strange. If somebody makes a wai to you, a slight bow alone is more than sufficient for ordinary occasions, and for business, most Thais will shake hands with foreigners instead of waiing anyway.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Dress"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Personal appearance"]}," is very important in Thailand as a measure of respect to other people, you will find that dressing appropriately means that you are shown more respect in return.  This translates in many ways, even sometimes lowering initial offering prices at markets. While some allowance is made for the differing customs of foreigners, Thais respond more positively to well-dressed Westerners. \n\nTraditionally, Thais are modest and conservative dressers. At a minimum your clothes should be neat, clean, and free from holes or tears. Except at the beach or at sacred sites normal western dress is acceptable for both men and women, except that you should avoid clothing showing a lot of skin. Pants are preferable to shorts, blouses should have capped sleeves, and if tank tops are worn, the straps should be thick (",{"type":"''","value":["i.e.,"]}," not spaghetti straps). Thai men generally wear pants, and most Thais view an adult man wearing shorts as fairly ridiculous; shorts are primarily worn by laborers and schoolchildren. Men's shorts should be knee length or more, if worn at all.\n\nTaking off one's shoes at temples and private homes is mandatory etiquette, and this may even be requested at some shops. Wear shoes that slip on and off easily. Flip-flops, hiking sandals, and clog-type shoes are usually a good pragmatic choice for traveling in Thailand; only in the most top-end establishments are shoes required.\n\nIt is best to play it safe with wats and other sacred sites in Thailand; your dress should be unambiguously modest and cover your entire torso and most of your limbs. For men, ankle-length pants are mandatory; on top, t-shirts are acceptable, though a button-front or polo shirt would be best. Many recommend that women wear only full length dresses and skirts; you should make sure that your clothing covers at least your shoulders and your knees and some places may require that you wear ankle-length pants or skirts and long sleeved tops. Shorts and sleeveless shirts are highly inappropriate, as are short skirts. The rules are even more strict for foreign visitors, so even if you see a local in shorts it's not OK for everyone.\n\nTopless sunbathing is common by Western women at many tourist beaches.

Women should make every effort to make way for monks on the street and give them room so they do not have to make contact with you. Women should avoid offering anything to a monk with their hands. Objects or donations should be placed in front of a monk so he can pick it up, or place it on a special cloth he carries with him. Monks will sometimes be aided by a layman who will accept things from women merit-makers on their behalf.\n\nTheravada Buddhist monks are also supposed to avoid material temptations and as such, are not allowed to touch money, so offering money to a monk is considered to be a sign of disrespect in most Theravada Buddhist cultures. Therefore, should you wish to donate to a monk, you should only offer food, and put your monetary donation in the appropriate donation box at the temple. Those monks that accept money are almost always fakes.\n\nAs in neighbouring countries, the swastika is widely used in Thailand as a Buddhist religious symbol. It pre-dates Nazism by 2,500 years and has no anti-Semitic connotations.\n\nWhen entering temples, always take off your shoes before you do so, as entering a temple with footwear is considered to be a major faux pas. When sitting on the floor in a temple, make sure you cross your legs under you \"mermaid-style\" so your feet do not point at any person or statue. Do not pose alongside a Buddha statue for a photo and certainly don't clamber on them. It's OK to take photos of a statue, but everyone should be facing it. Also, as doorway thresholds are considered a sanctuary for spirits, it's important not to step on a raised threshold, but rather to step over it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The Royal Family"]},"\nIt's illegal to show ",{"type":"'''","value":["disrespect to royalty"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["lèse-majesté"]},"), a crime which carries up to ",{"type":"'''","value":["15 to 20 years"]}," imprisonment. Do not make any negative remarks, or any remarks which might be perceived as disrespectful about the King or any members of the Royal Family. Since the King is on the country's currency, don't burn, tear, or mutilate it - especially in the presence of other Thais.

Also, anything related to the stories and movies ",{"type":"''","value":["The King and I"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Anna and the King"]}," is illegal to possess in Thailand. Almost all Thais, even those in other countries, feel very strongly when it comes to any version of this story. They feel that it makes a mockery of their age-old monarchy and is entirely inaccurate.

During night hours, mahouts (trainers) with lumbering elephants approach tourists to feed the creatures bananas or take a photo with them for a fee. The elephants are brought to the city to beg in this way because they are out of work and are mistreated and visibly distressed under the conditions of the city. Please avoid supporting this cruelty by rejecting the mahouts as they offer you bananas to feed the elephants.\n\nDrugged animals such as lizards and birds are sometimes used by touts as photo subjects. These touts are often seen plying the main tourist beaches of Thailand. The tout will take a photo with you and the doped up animal and then demand payment. \n\nRare and endangered species are often sold at markets for pets, and many other animal products are sold as luxury items. Avoid buying rare pets, leather, ivory, talons, dried sea creatures (such as starfish), fur, feathers, teeth, wool, and other products since they are most likely the result of illegal poaching, and buying them contributes greatly to animal endangerment and abuse.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Other"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The head is considered the most exalted part of the body, feet the lowliest.

Essentials are a swimming costume, a day pack, an umbrella in rainy season and some warm clothes if travelling in Oct-Dec, as some areas get cool. Some sources say there is no point in bringing a raincoat during the warm rainy season because it is so hot and sticky your raincoat will be uncomfortable.\n\nYou will only need a couple of changes of clothes as you can get washing done anywhere cheaply. Sandals for when your hiking shoes are too hot can be bought cheaply in Thailand, although large sizes for women are harder to come by. If female and anything above a size 2 (US), size 6 (UK & IRL), size 36 (rest of EU), busty, or tall, it is often difficult to find clothes that will fit you in any of the Thai shops. If you are male and have a waist more than 38\" you will have trouble finding pants. You will largely be limited to backpacker gear (the omnipresent fisherman pants and \"Same Same\" t-shirts) or Western imports in Bangkok malls, for the same prices as back home or more. While laundry is cheap, it is useful to bring a few changes of clothes, as you may sweat your way through several outfits a day in the Thai weather. \n\nTake enough padlocks for every double zipper to stop wandering hands and lock up your belongings, even in your hotel room. Lock zippers through the lower holes, ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," the upper ones on the pull tabs — although even this precaution won't help much if you encounter a razor-blade artist.\n\nTake snorkeling gear or buy it on arrival if you plan to spend a lot of your time in the water. Alternatively put up a notice looking for gear from someone who is leaving. A tent for camping if you are a national park buff is a good idea, as is a compass. You might like to bring compact binoculars too if wildlife is your thing. A good map of Thailand is also handy. \n\nTake earplugs for when you're stuck in a noisy room or want to sleep on the bus. Take a mirror for shaving, as often budget places won’t have any. String is very handy for hanging up washing. Cigarette papers can be difficult to find, except in tourist centres. Climbing shoes for rock climbing are useful as Thailand has some of the best cliffs in Southeast Asia. \n\nIf you have prescription glasses, it is a good idea to bring a spare pair of glasses or contact lenses plus a copy of your prescription. Bring a book you're prepared to swap. A personal music player is great as a huge range of cheap music is available everywhere. \n\nInto the toiletries bag throw sun screen and insect repellent. Mosquito coils are also a good idea. A small pocket size torch \/ flashlight will come in handy when the electricity goes out or for investigating caves. Passport photos come in handy for visas. \n\nIf you plan to travel long distances by motorbike, purchase a good quality helmet, which you can do in Thailand. Last but not least, pack your stuff in plastic bags to stop them from getting wet, especially when travelling in the rainy season or on boats.\n\nAside from the above, the following are recommended:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Prescriptions for any prescription medications being brought through customs "]},{"type":"*","value":[" Travel insurance"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Blood donor\/type card"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Details of your next of kin"]},{"type":"*","value":[" A second photo ID other than your passport"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Credit card plus a backup card for a separate account"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Electricity"]},"\nElectrical power in Thailand is 220V, 50Hz.

If you have one, you can buy a prepaid SIM card for any of the Thai carriers in any convenience store for as little as 50-200 baht and charge it up as you go. The Bangkok airport is a good place to buy a SIM card, since the people working at the counters there speak relatively good English. \n\nMost phones sold by major carriers are \"locked\" to the carrier. That means that the phone won't work with a SIM card on another network, unless you get it unlocked. Unlocking a phone involves entering a special code into the phone. The procedure for entering this code depends on the specific phone. Most carriers will give you the unlock code, and instructions on how to unlock it, if you have been a subscriber in good standing (bills paid) for a certain period (about 3 months, but depends on the carrier). Contact your carrier's customer service department, and tell them you plan to use your phone overseas. They will usually give you the unlock code. Once unlocked, you can use any SIM card in the phone. Alternatively, the wizards at Bangkok's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok\/Siam Square#Buy"],["MBK"]]}," shopping mall can unlock most phones for less than 500 baht. If you need to buy a mobile phone, you can pick those up at MBK as well, as a huge selection of cheap second-hand mobiles can be found on the 4th floor. \n\nInternational rates from Thai carriers are surprisingly good.

Note that you should also use prefixes (006 for better quality, 00600 for a cheaper rate. However, for some countries, the rate is same for both promotions. How to get cheaper rates, as well as rates for selected countries, is clearly listed on SIM card packages.\n\nCoverage is very good throughout the country, all cities and tourist destinations (including resort islands) are well covered, and even in the countryside it's more likely you'll get a network signal than not, especially with an AIS or DTAC SIM. However, if you plan extended stays in remote non-tourist areas, AIS (their prepaid service name is \"1-2-Call\") is a better choice, at the expense of more pricey local calls than DTAC. But the difference, once very significant, is becoming less and less over time, both in call rates and coverage. TrueMove coverage is considered the worst, with phones occasionally losing signal even in towns. Nevertheless, if you plan to stay only in major cities\/islands, and\/or don't need your phone available all the time when outside of them, True SIM is OK too.

AIS uses even more exotic (for 3G service) 900 MHz band, which is normally used for GSM, so the chances that your 3G device will work with their 3G are even less.\n\nBesides these, there are a couple of lesser-known options:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" TOT 3G and several resellers offer 3G at 2100 MHz (compatible with most 3G phones and USB dongles) throughout greater Bangkok.

Its 3G services operate under the 2100MHz frequency. Getting hold of a SIM card outside Bangkok is a challenge though. The website is well designed in English and you can manage\/top up your account online."]},"\nMany smartphones will access the Internet in the background, even when you're not actually using the phone or the Internet. This can eat up your minutes quickly, and then will start to consume your remaining baht much faster,if you have a time-based package. It's best to use either volume-based or unlimited package in this case. Alternatively, make sure your phone has a reliable way of turning off the Internet usage. For Android phones, try APNDroid, available in the Android Market. For iPhones, you may need to jailbreak your phone and install SBSettings.\n\nSome smart phones may require you to manually enter the APN (Access Point Name) for the Internet to work. APNs have many configurable parameters, but typically only a few pieces of data are necessary. Check your phone's settings; the procedure for editing APNs varies for different phones.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" DTAC - APN Name: www.dtac.co.th, Username: guest, Password: guest"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" AIS - APN Name: internet, Username: ais (may not be necessary), Password: ais (may not be necessary)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" TrueMove - APN Name: internet, Username: internet, Password: internet "]},"\nTopping up an Internet package isn't as straightforward as topping up voice minutes, but not impossible even if you can't speak Thai. While you can easily top up voice minutes at any convenience store, you will likely get a blank stare if you ask for Internet packages. Internet packages can be topped up at cell phone stores, which are easy enough to find in populated areas - however, it is not likely that they'll be aware of all current promotions and options. More services, obviously, will be available at numerous operator's offices (DTAC shop, TrueMove shop, etc.) generally available at the big malls\/trade centres (Big C, Tesco, etc.) as well as other public places - refer to your operator's website for details. Alternatively, you can just call the customer support (1678 for DTAC, 1331 for True, 1175 for AIS) - they can both consult you about the nearest office location, if you still need it, or turn off\/on any Internet (or SMS or MMS) package you request. However, calls to these service numbers often aren't free for prepaid SIM users, with calling rate up to (DTAC) 3 baht\/minute. If you do not want to spend that every time you need to switch - there are numbers where you can do-it-yourself using a voice menu (free of charge): *1004 for DTAC Happy (Thai language only), *9000 for True (in English, at least for the Inter-SIM handed out in the airports).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThailand borders on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malaysia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burma"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambodia"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laos"]]},".
