Apart from being a source of water for Thane and its larger neighbour ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mumbai"]},", the lakes are also tourist attractions. The areas surrounding the city are beautiful.

The city crops up again in the Middle Ages and slabs and copper plates dating back to the period have been discovered in Thane. One of them, dug up from the foundations of Thane Fort in 1787, dated 1078 AD, is apparently a land grant from Arikesara Devaraja, sovereign of the city of Tagara, wherein he address the inhabitants of a city called Sri Sthanaka. Friar Jordanus, a great traveler, who visited the city between AD 1321 and 1324, describes it as being under a Muslim governor. He leaves a detailed sketch of early Christians in Thane and refers to the martyrdom of four Christian priests in the region, more than 200 years before the Portuguese ever set foot in India. The celebrated Ibn Batuta and Abul Feda, contemporaries of Friar Jordanus, also came here. They refer to Thane as Kukin Tana and speak of its fame as a port from which ships sailed to the gulf carrying a kind of cloth called 'Tanasi' which was produced in Thane. Duarte Barbosa, a noted traveler, described Thane by the name Tana Mayambu 25 years before the Portuguese conquest. He paints a vivid picture of the town as one of Moorish mosques and temples, with many pleasant gardens. The Portuguese came to Thane about 1530 and ruled for over 200 years till 1739. Thane was then known as Cacabe de Tana. Work on the Thane Fort began in 1730. The Marathas, who conquered Bassein and Thane in 1737 and 1739, held sway over the region till 1784, when the British captured the Fort and ruled Thane, then also called Tana. They made it the headquarters of the district administration with a district collector stationed in Thane. \n\nThe Thane Municipal Council was formed in 1863 when the city had a population of 9000 souls. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Economy"]},"\n\nThane is witnessing a gradual transition from being a manufacturing hub to an economy driven by services sector. The State government in general and MIDC in particular are also acting as a catalyst to boost this transition. The Wagle Estate MIDC is gradually becoming a major IT & ITES, services industry hub. The Ashar IT Park marks a key milestone towards achieving it. \n\nMost of the global IT & ITES companies have started shifting focus and relocating to Thane on account of its cost efficiencies and highly skilled low attrition manpower. The IT parks are built using state-of-the-art technology, packed with all the ingredients comparable to any international IT park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe nearest airport is the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airportsindia.org.in\/aai\/mumbai\/index.htm"]},", Mumbai. Once you get off, you will need to take a taxi or hire a car. The distance to Thane is about 36 kilometers (22 miles), the drive can take between 45 to 75 minutes depending on the traffic.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nMumbai's taxis are allowed into Thane.

The fare you pay at the counter includes the toll you need to pay when you leave Mumbai.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe best way to get to Thane from Mumbai using public transport is to take the local train service.  \n\nAlthough Andheri is the nearest railway station from the airport a better option would be to take an auto-rikshaw to Kurla or Ghatkopar station(both these stations fall on the central suburban line) and then board any suburban Northbound Local Suburban train (all local suburban trains halt at Thane)to Thane. You've the option to board a fast or a slow train. But better option is to board Thane Local Train which ends at Thane station. Trains can be located by Abbrevations for example T - Thane so any train with T abbrevation on Digital Train time display will end at Thane. \n\nThe auto-rikshaw ride to Kurla or Ghatkopar stations would cost a little more, about Rs 60 to Rs 70, compared with Andheri which will be about Rs.40 to Rs.50 but you would end up saving about 1 hour to 1&1\/2 hour. An added benefit is that you get to board a direct train to Thane thus avoiding the change over at Dadar.\n\nOther option if you are coming from the airport is, take an auto-rickshaw to Andheri station which is served by the Western Railway and buy a ticket to Thane. You need to take a southbound train towards Churchgate, get off at Dadar (which is the interchange point) if possible avoid peak hour journey if you are new in Mumbai specially between 8 and 11AM or between 6 and 8PM, get on the Central Railway Line and then take a northbound train to Thane.
