The southern part of the district is highly urbanised as it borders Bombay, while the northern part is rural and home to a poor tribal population. \n\nThe southern cities are home to a large commuter population as they are reasonably well-connected by Bombay's local trains. Unfortunately, except for Thane and Navi Mumbai, the others are unliveable hellholes and suffer from overcrowding, poor civic facilities and filth. In addition, they are often ruled by landgrabbing mafia dons. In complete contrast, Thane and Navi Mumbai are better planned, have good roads and are quite liveable. In fact, Thane city was once judged the cleanest city in India. \n\nOnce you move away from the cities, you will find great beauty in the form of hills, beaches and forests. Many small rivers flow down from the Sahyadri mountains to the Arabian sea, and some of these supply water to Bombay and Thane.
