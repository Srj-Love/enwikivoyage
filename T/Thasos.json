Visiting Thasos offers a quiet and relaxing holiday, since the island can satisfy mostly nature oriented tourists. Thasos northern and eastern areas are verdurous places that have many little villages and sandy beaches with clear waters. The southern and western areas are gradually regenerating after the 1989 fire that destroyed most of the vegetation. The road system of the island is well defined and circles the island coastwise. By car you can reach most of the natural sites of the island as well as Mount Ipsarion. There are many attractions in Thasos, mostly related to archeological sites, waterfalls, roads around the coastline and in the heart of the mountain, underwater activities and water sports, riding horses.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nGreek is the official language of Greece, and therefore it's spoken by all the permanent inhabitants of the island and most of its visitors, but the foreign visitor will have no problem at all communicating in foreign languages, mainly in English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThasos does not have its own airport, so the only way on or off the island is by boat.
