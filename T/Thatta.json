Thatta's unique cultural and architectural landscape attract many tourists throughout the year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Shah Jahan Mosque7.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["Shah Jahan Mosque was a gift to people of Thatta by that Mughal King"]]},"\nSome believe Thatta is the same port city which was situated once on the Indus River during Indian campaign of Alexander the Great. \n\nAbout four centuries ago, Thatta was a famous center of learning, arts and commerce and the capital city of three dynasties: Samma (1335 AD-1520 AD), Arghun  (1520 AD-1555 AD) and Tarkhan Dynasty (1554 AD - 1591 AD). The city was later ruled by the Mughal emperors of Delhi from 1592 to 1739. Thatta was a prosperous and flourishing city in those days and the city was an important commercial and cultural centre. Thatta's importance started to decline when Sindh was given up to Nader Shah, the ruler of Iran (1736–1747), and after the capital was moved to Hyderabad in 1768, Thatta fell into neglect. But the three dynasties and the Mughals left their mark in the city in the form of unique architecture such as monuments of Makli and Shah Jahan Mosque, which was built during the golden age of the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThatta lies on the National Highway # N-5, the longest highway in Pakistan, which travel via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peshawar"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rawalpindi"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gujranwala"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lahore"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Multan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sukkur"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hyderabad (Pakistan)"],["Hyderabad"]]}," and continues to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karachi"]]}," after passing Thatta.\n\nDespite being the country's most important and largest highway, part of N-5 between Hyderabad and Karachi is not used very much nowadays, since the newer M-9 Super Highway has shortened the distance between two major cities of Sindh. Non-air conditioned buses and minibuses are easily available throughout the day both from the bus stations in nearby major cities of Karachi and Hyderabad and can also be hailed from the highway. A trip may cost Rs 150 and the journey can take less than 2 hours either way. Travel distance is 100 km either from Karachi or Hyderabad.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are dozens of the ubiquitous rickshaws in Thatta. They can be found on the street, around the main bus stop on N-5 and outside the attraction areas. Rickshaws are generally a cheap mode to travel as well the most available mode of transport in town and most preferred too. The town is not a large town so you should be able to get most places within 30 minutes at the most and Rs 200 should be enough to take you from one place in town to the other.\n\nOn the other hand, Thatta is a small town. Most of the restaurants and accommodation are situated on the main bus line on N-5 and distances can be easily covered simply by walking rather than hoping on a rickshaw unless your destination is not near. Some structures of tombs of Makli and remains of old houses are scattered inside the narrow streets of Thatta that are worth exploring on foot. Always ensure you walk on the footpath, or if one isn't available, as far to the side of the road as possible and on the right facing on-coming traffic.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["A tip works"],["The gates of several big mausoleums such as of Isa Khan Hussain II remain closed and only visitors having written permission from Sindh's Archaeological Department are allowed inside.
