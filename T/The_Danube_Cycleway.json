Although individual routes may vary, the total length is estimated at over 2800 km. Nearly 1700 km covers the stretch from Budapest to the Black Sea.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Travel "]},"\n\nThere are several entry and exit points on the route, including several major cities. As the Danube long has been a thoroughfare for traffic of all kinds, there are also numerous and varied opportunities for food and board along the way. Several tour operators offer self-guided or fully guided bicycle tours on stretches of the route, including baggage transfer.\n\nOne relatively cheap way to get to the beginning of the Austrian side of the cycleway from most of Europe is a budget flight to Bratislava, followed by train to Vienna, and then train to Passau. Then cycle to Budapest. From Budapest, you can get the train back to Vienna, and then another train to Bratislava for the return flight. Note that this route misses out the Donaueschingen to Passau section.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Renting bikes "]},"\n\nRenting bikes is often cheaper and easier than taking your own bike.
