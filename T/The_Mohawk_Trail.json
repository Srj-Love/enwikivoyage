Native Americans --primarily the Mohawks in the west and the Pocumtucks in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Connecticut River Valley"]]}," to the east-- used the trail in their migrations, and they had long-established treaties regarding hunting and fishing rights along its length.

The Europeans initially hoped that political unrest between the tribes would further their own ends, and they began to manipulate one tribe against the other. Although the Europeans later attempted to arrange a peace conference to settle the differences of the two tribes, eventually a full-scale war broke out, with the Mohawks ultimately gaining the upper hand. Since no one ever names anything after the losers, the path eventually became known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["\"Mohawk Trail.\""]},"  \n\nWith the end of the Indian Wars and the beginning of the American Revolution, the old trail was gradually rerouted and widened to accommodate wagon traffic between the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]}," and the interior towns, particularly ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Adams"]]},".\n \nBy the early part of the 20th century people began to appreciate just how beautiful the region encompassing the trail was, so in October of 1914 the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Massachusetts"]]}," State Legislature declared the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mohawk Trail"]}," a scenic tourist route. It was during this time that the mountainous, winding stretch of road --especially the section named ",{"type":"''","value":["The Mohawk Trail Scenic Byway"]},"-- really began to explode with popularity. Previously, the fastest route from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Adams"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]}," was by rail via the 4.5 mile Hoosac Tunnel, which traveled through the Hoosac Mountain --one of the largest mountains that the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mohawk Trail"]}," climbs and winds over. But as cars were becoming more affordable in 1914, the thrill and challenge of driving over the Hoosac Mountain, instead of through it, began to draw families from everywhere in the Northeast. Stretching from the 1920's through the 1950's, the road became a travel destination in itself and small shops, campgrounds, and trading posts began to pop up. Today, the excitement and fascination with this stretch of road seems to be surging like never before, and it has drawn enough attention as a vacation spot that the towns and surrounding areas are now referred to as ",{"type":"'''","value":["The ",{"type":"''","value":["Mohawk Trail"]}," Region"]},".
