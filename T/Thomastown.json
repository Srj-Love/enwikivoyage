It is on the bank of the river Nore and is famous for Jerpoint Abbey, Kilfane Glen gardens, and Mount Juliet Golf Course. Thomastown lies in a valley. Thomastown is 17km southeast from Kilkenny on the R700. It is the middle town on a series of towns dotted along the River Nore. To the northwest is Bennettsbridge. To the southeast is Inistioge.  If driving please note that the centre of Thomastown operates a one way system due to the narrow nature of the streets in its core. The town has grown substantially over the past decade due to its proxminity to Kilkenny and less expensive housing. The town has all the essential services required for tourists. In the last year a new Super Valu and Lidl supermarket opened on the road towards Gowran on the edge of town. The town's best aforementioned attractions lie a couple of kilometres outside the town all in different directions so a car will be required to see them. Be sure to visit the watergarden in the town just off the main street.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nJJ Kavanangh's bus services between Waterford and Dublin pass through the town.
