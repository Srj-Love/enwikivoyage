During the 18th and most of the 19th century, it was a choke point on the St.Lawrence and therefore of vital military importance for both the young United States and the British colony of Canada.  The colonial and military influence is still visible on the Canadian side in towns like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kingston (Ontario)"],["Kingston"]]},", which was established in 1673 as Cataraqui, a small and then-distant French military outpost which controlled entry of fur trading vessels into the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Lakes"]]},".

Dubbed Millionaire's Row, these lavish homes are visible by taking a boat cruises down the river. For New York City's elite, the region was close enough to be readily accessible by train but distant enough to be a welcome break from city life of the era.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Boldt Castle, Thousand Islands, Grens Canada, USA.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Boldt Castle"]]},"\nThe popularisation of the now-famous \"Thousand Islands\" salad dressing dates to this period; while accounts differ, the dressing appears to have originated in Alexandria Bay or Clayton where New York City stage actress May Irwin requested the recipe from Sophia LaLonde (wife of local fishing guide George LaLonde Jr.) to pass it on to George Boldt of Waldolf-Astoria hotel fame (who built Boldt Castle in the region for his wife, Louise). Boldt brought the recipe back to the chefs of the grand New York City hotel, where it would gain fame and popularity.\n\nThe largest of the thousand islands, the 20-mile (32 km) long Wolfe Island, was a primarily-agricultural community once home to many tiny, local dairies; among a thousand regional recipes collected from across Canada by the authors of a ",{"type":"''","value":["Laura Secord Canadian Cook Book"]}," is a \"Wolfe Island Cheese Soufflé\". The cheesemakers are now long gone, as are docks and customs facilities which formerly welcomed ships at what was once Port Metcalfe at the easternmost end of the island. A canal which once took vessels from Kingston across Wolfe Island to Carleton Island (NY) and the US mainland rests abandoned. Many farms and cottages remain; a modern addition to the island are forests of electric generation windmills which stand three hundred feet (100m) above the otherwise-rural landscape. The island is popular among bicyclists because of its easy accessibility by provincial ferry from downtown Kingston.\n\nOn the Canadian side, Garden Island was once a shipbuilding centre; the history of the former Calvin Shipyard is recorded in Kingston's Marine Museum of the Great Lakes. As the current Wolfe Island ferry (unlike its predecessors) has never stopped at Garden Island, the settlement is largely a ghost town. A few cottages remain, accessible only seasonally by private watercraft.\n\nOn the US side, Grindstone Island once housed a small community and a pair of one-room schoolhouses. While the ferry to Clayton (New York) no longer runs and the schools are now closed, a handful of residents remain. In some places (such as Carleton Island NY) what were once magnificent mansions built in the era of the Thousand Islands as playground for New York's wealthy now stand as deteriorating ruins.\n\nNow, the region is mainly cottage country, extremely popular during July and August holidays.

From there, you can either continue across the Thousand Islands Bridge to Wellesley Island and Canada, or follow NYS Route 12 along the River.

In 2009, the United States began deployment of Predator drones on its northern borders, some of which are based at Fort Drum NY (near Watertown). In 2011, Canadian officials attempted to seize a boat from a US recreational fisherman in Canadian waters despite the boat having neither landed nor anchored in Canada; its skipper was adrift in the Gananoque Narrows with a valid Ontario fishing licence.
