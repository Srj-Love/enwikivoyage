These roads can provide stunning vistas, and are frequented by bicyclists, motorcycle and car clubs, and the occasional group of joyriding teenagers, so visitors are advised to be aware of their surroundings, share the road, and exercise caution.\n\nAirports in close proximity to Thousand Oaks are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles International Airport"]]}," (LAX) and Bob Hope Airport in Burbank ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.burbankairport.com\/"]},".
