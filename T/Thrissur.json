The entire city is formed around the grand Shiva temple known as Vadakumnathan Temple. The temple is in the center of a mega roundabout that is of 64 acres. This round is known as Swaraj Round.

The name is appropriate, for Thrissur derives its main glory from Vadakunnathan Temple, (Vadakum Nathan, Lord of the North) that dominates the topography of the town. Trichur is of hoary fame, and the origin of Vadakkunnathan Temple is ascribed to Parasurama, the legendary hero who is said to have reclaimed Kerala from the sea by throwing an axe across the sea from the north. In historical times it was a suburb of Musiris port of Chera Kings mentioned in Silapathikaram of Sangam Tamil Period.\n\nFrom very early times Thrissur has been a centre of learning and, with the decline of Buddhism and Jainism and the establishment of the supremacy of Brahmanism during the revival of Hinduism, Thrissur became an important centre of Sanskrit learning. The great ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adi Sankara"]]}," had taught ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Advaita"]]}," here. After his travels in different regions of India he is believed to have come back and settled in Thrissur and died here. Sankara Acharya's disciples Hastamalaka, Thotaka, Padmapada and Sudhachara established in the town four Madams, namely the Northern Madam, the Middle Madam, the In-Between Madam and the Southern Madam respectively, all of which are extant except the In-Between one.\n\nThrissur occupies a prominent place in the history and culture of Kerala and is said to be the Cultural Capital of the State. It is also one of the main trade centers in the state. The present Thrissur District was carved out of a bigger District of the same name on 1 Apr 1958. It derives its name from the location of its headquarters at Thrissur. The town is  built around a hillock atop which is the Vadakkumnathan Kshethram or temple which has Shiva as the presiding deity.\n\nThrissur  rose in importance due to Raja Rama Varma, popularly known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Sakthan Thampuran"]},"  who ascended the throne of Kochi in 1790.  Large areas of Thrissur were captured by the Zamorins of Kozhikode in the 14th and 15th centuries. In the latter half of the 18th century,  Tipu Sultan held sway over Thrissur until the European domination began under the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the English.\n\nLong ago, the vast open area around the temple was a magnificent teak forest called Thekkinkadu. Today, the forest has given way to one of the most important examples of Kerala's architecture which often does away with the imposing ",{"type":"''","value":["gopurams"]}," of South Indian Temples.  This temple features low, tiled roofs, an abundance of woodwork, and the famous ",{"type":"''","value":["koothambalam"]}," or theater hall with sloping roofs of metal plates within which is performed the dramatic art form ",{"type":"''","value":["chakiar koothu"]},".  The Vadakkumnathan temple is also well known for its murals depicting scenes from the Mahabharatha as well as exquisite paintings and carvings.\n\nSouth East corner of the district is bounded by Tamil Nadu.  The Periyar,  Chalakudy, Karuvannur and Ponnani (Bharatha Puzha) are the main river systems in the district.\n\nA place of great antiquity, Thrissur was also known by such names as ",{"type":"''","value":["Vrishabhadripuram"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Then Kailasm"]}," in ancient days. The famous Kerala Kalamandalam, Cheruthuruthi, founded by the late poet Vallathol Narayana Menon, is in Thrissur District.
