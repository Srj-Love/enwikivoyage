The name of the city derives from the Celtic term ",{"type":"''","value":["Dunum"]},", meaning \"fortified city\". It fell to Rome in 58 BC, when Roman legions conquered almost all Switzerland, and soon became one of the main centres of Roman administration in the region.\n\nThe Romans were driven out of Thun, and out of the rest of Switzerland, by the Burgundians around 400 AD. The Aar became the frontier between the Christian Burgundians and the Pagan, German-speaking Alemanni, who lived north. Thun was mentioned for the first time during the 7th century, in the chronicle of Frankish monk Fredgar.\n\nThe region of Thun became a part of the Holy Roman Empire in 1033, when Conrad II gained the title of King of Burgundy. The emperors entrusted the Zähringen family, centred in Bern, to subdue the unruly nobles of central Switzerland. Around 1190 Duke Bertold V of Zähringen, built a castle in Thun and expanded the city. After Bertold's death in 1218, his territories went to Ulrich III von Kyburg.\n\nIn 1264 Thun received state rights and in 1384 the town was bought by the canton of Bern. Thun was the capital of the Oberland canton of the Helvetic Republic.\n\nIn 1819 a Military School was founded in the city, which later developed in the main military school in Switzerland. Thun was connected to the railway network of Switzerland in 1859 and telephone access was made available in 1888.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThun is located just outside the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berne"]]}," metropolitan area and is served by its suburban trains: the S1 of the Berne S-Bahn operates from Berne to Thun in 30 min, and the S4+S44 lines in 40 min (via Belp).
