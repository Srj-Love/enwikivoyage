The population of Thunder Bay is 122,907 (2006 census).\n\nA few decades back there were two towns here named Fort William and Port Arthur and the combination was often referred to as \"the lakehead\". Today we have the city of Thunder Bay instead, but the town names are still used for districts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThunder Bay is on ",{"type":"'''","value":["Trans-Canada Highway 11 and 17"]},".

This is largely due its Twin-Cities heritage which causes the city to be very spread out. Until 1970, the city was actually two separate large communities (Fort William and Port Arthur) separated by a swamp that has since been built up.  City council seems to finally, in recent years, be developing the north end (Port Arthur) into an entertainment district with the Marina Park as its centrepiece, and the south end (Fort William) into a business district.  Within each of these districts (North end and South end downtown cores) walking is certainly viable in the non-winter months. During the winter months, your face will freeze off.\n\nAs a result of this, your best way to get between these two zones is by bus.  Up-to-date schedules are available on the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.thunderbay.ca\/transit Thunder Bay Transit"]}," website.\n\nAlternatively, there are multiple taxi services.\n\nThe city is increasingly focused on expanding its network of bicycle paths as well.
