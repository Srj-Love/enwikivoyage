Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea.\n\nTianjin is divided into the old city and the Binhai New Area. Binhai New Area is growing fast, with many international companies establishing branch offices. It is a base of China's advanced industry, financial reform, and innovation.\n\nIn terms of urban population, it is the sixth-largest city of the People's Republic of China. Tianjin's urban area is located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal in Tianjin. Tianjin was once home to foreign concessions in the late Qing Dynasty and early Kuomintang era.\n\nTianjin's climate is similar to, though slightly warmer than, its neighbour ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]},". Overall it can be described as continental; winters are cold and dry, as nights below −10 °C are not uncommon, and summers are hot and humid, with days reaching above the upper 30's °C not out of the question. The best time to visit is autumn, though if you do not mind dust storms, spring would also be an excellent choice.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nTianjin has been trading port since historic times and was previously called \"Zhigu\" (直沽), or \"Straight Port\". In until 1404, the Yongle Emperor renamed the city Tianjin, meaning \"the Heavenly Ford\", to indicate that the Emperor forded the river at that point.\n\nDue to its proximity to Beijing, Tianjin was involved significantly during the Opium Wars.

One-way tickets are ¥55 for Economy, ¥66 for Business, or ¥94 for VIP. The bullet train designation is a 'C' and takes about 33 minutes, travelling up to 300 km\/h. Some C-series trains make a stop in Wuqing, add 5 more minutes to the whole trip.\n\nThere are shuttle buses between Tianjin railway station and Tianjin airport. A ticket costs ¥15 per trip. It  stops about 200 m from the train station northern gate (back gate). When one get down from the shuttle bus, just walk along the pavement and you will reach the train station.\n\nShould you choose to take taxi, use the official taxi stand (just follow the signage). The taxi fare from Tianjin railway station to Tianjin airport is about ¥50-65. It is not advisable to use any of the touts that offer taxi services. The official taxi stand has plenty of taxis.\n\nIf leaving the station by taxi, be prepared for a production-line approach to getting the punters into taxis. Marshals keep the queue moving so have baggage ready to stow and a destination in mind or possibly be forced to go to the back of the line and wait your turn again.\n\nTianjin South Railway Station handles some of the high-speed rail service to Shanghai. It is not near the city, although there are some bus routes from the South Railway Station to the city, and the taxis are mostly of the illegal variety, so plan accordingly. The renovated Tianjin West Station also handles the high-speed rail service to Shanghai. It can be reached by Tianjin Metro Line 1. Tianjin South serves as an intermediate station for bullet trains between Beijing South and Shanghai Hongqiao.

Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four compass directions.\n\nTianjin has three ring roads. Unlike Beijing, the Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is the closest thing to a highway-level ring road, although traffic is often chaotic and sometimes more than chaotic.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nTianjin is well connected with other cities via bus.

Within the city, traveling on a bus line that is less than 12 km (7 km) will cost ¥1.5, while ¥1 will cover a journey on any line over 12 kilometres, even if you travel less than 12 km (7 mi) but on a line that is over this distance, the cost is still ¥1. It's well worth your time to look up popular bus routes. Buses are comfortable and clean.\n\nThe old Tianjin metro was suspended in 2001, but after refurbishing was re-opened in 2006. In addition, a light-rail line runs between the urban area of Zhongshanmen to the seaside area Donghailu in TEDA.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis are abundant. The minimum cost for 3 km is ¥8, (¥1.7 per km thereafter). Taxis also charge for the time while the vehicle is stationary at ¥1.7 for every five minutes (cost is exempt for less than five minutes). It is strongly recommended to avoid taxis from near the railway station. See note in the Get in-By train section above about how to avoid train station taxis. The same advice applies at tourist stops, it is best to walk a few blocks to a regular street to catch a metered taxi. Ride with illegal taxis at your own risk.\n\nThere are Tianjin tourist maps with destinations written in Chinese characters and English. Pointing at where you want to go will get you a long way with taxi drivers. It might be a good idea to take a magnifying glass along as many of the drivers have trouble with the small font.\n\nYou can rent a taxi driver for the day or even for just a few hours. The drivers are happy to wait, and the cost for two hours would be less than ¥100.\n\nAnother caution about taxis is that there are toll roads in some parts of China. In a taxi, you will be expected to pay the base fare plus the toll fee. The driver pays the toll and receives a receipt at the toll booth. At your destination, you ask for the receipt(s) and pay that amount plus the base fare. If you are going a long way, you may also be asked to pay for the return toll fee. That is a legitimate request, although you could argue that the driver will pick up another fare to pay for the toll anyway.  You may or may not succeed with the driver.\n\nTipping isn't common practice, as in most Chinese cities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By metro"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tianjin Metro System Map 1.png"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Map of Tianjin Metro and Binhai Mass Transit"]]},"\n\nThe municipality consists of two rapid transit systems, Tianjin Metro and Binhai Mass Transit.

Later it was named by Puyi, the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty on July 1929 when he settled here with his wives. “Jing” means stillness in English and the Garden was named by the emperor who tried to strengthen himself with noble spirit by living in a peaceful environment. Jingyuan Garden with an area of 3360 square meters consists of three sets of courtyards, the front yard, the back yard and the side yard. The main building is a two-storied Spanish architecture. The first floor serves as a living room, a dining room, guest rooms and a kitchen, while the second floor as bedrooms, a library and a chamber. The exterior walls and balconies with projecting brims were used to add more room to the building. In front of the garden will be built a garden, in which enormous poplars, pagoda trees and cloves are planted and some ponds and pavilions are constructed. Besides, a reception office, a kitchen, a garage and a tennis court will be built on the northeast side of the garden. Jingyuan Garden integrates different architecture styles, such as Japanese and Spanish. The structure and material of gates are of typical Japanese style, simple and plain, while the low pitched roof and the detailed decoration are of obvious Spanish architecture style.
