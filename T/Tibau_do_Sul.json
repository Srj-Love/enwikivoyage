The municipality contains three coastal villages, Tibau do Sul, Pipa and Sibaúma, and several kilometers of sandy beaches surrounded by cliffs. Praia da Pipa and its surrounding beaches, near the village of Pipa, are among the most beautiful and probably the most famous of the state.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nFor a long time, Tibau do Sul and Pipa were relatively isolated fishing and farming villages. The origins of Sibaúma are not precisely known, but it is likely to have originated from a ",{"type":"''","value":["quilombo"]},", a settlement of escaped African slaves.\n\nDuring the 70s, the region started to attract surfers, and later the tourists would start to come. Nowadays, Pipa is the most popular and \"touristy\" of the three villages, containing various lodging options and significant nightlife, whereas Sibaúma is the most unspoiled.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThe bus between Natal and Tibau do Sul\/Pipa is operated by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.expresso-oceano.com.br\/ Expresso Oceano"]},", and costs R$ 10,50. Check the website for up-to-date routes and itineraries; be aware that there are no buses in either direction during the night. The bus departs from the intercity bus terminal of Natal (Avenida Cap-mor. Gouveia, 1237 - Cidade da Esperança), but if you are staying in Ponta Negra, you may more conveniently pick the bus at Natal Shopping (Av. Sen. Salgado Filho, 2234 - Candelária).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nFrom Natal, take the BR101 motorway, and ride about 78 km until Goianinha. There, take RN-003 to Tibau do Sul\/Pipa by following the signs. In the bifurcation, going left will lead you to Tibau do Sul and going right to Pipa.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By dune buggy"]},"\n\nWith a dune buggy or a similarly powerful vehicle, it is possible to go to Tibau do Sul and Pipa riding alongside the coast. Eventually, you will reach Malembá beach, and to get to Tibau do Sul you need to take a ferry boat to cross Lagoa das Guaraíras. Pipa is just further south.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nIt is possible to go by bus from one village to another using the intercity bus of Expresso Oceano (the same that goes to Natal). Buses to Sibaúma are less frequent. It costs R$ 1 between Tibau do Sul-Pipa and Pipa-Sibaúma. Car and buggy are obvious alternatives.\n\nNaturally, you may just walk from one village to another, but be prepared, as the distance between Tibau do Sul and Pipa is about 7 km (and about the same between Pipa and Sibaúma).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Chapadão de Pipa"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=south of Pipa village"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Corresponds to the plateau dividing the Amor and Minas beaches, that offers wonderful views of the surrounding beaches."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Lagoa de Guaraíras"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=north of Tibau do Sul village"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A 7-km lagoon that opens to the sea.
