The trail runs high on the northern side of the gorge passing through quiet villages, shady forest, blustery precipice and verdant terraced farmland. The snow covered peaks of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain (玉龙雪山; YuLong XueShan; 5596m) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haba"]]}," Snow Mountain (哈巴雪山; Haba Xueshan, 5396m) shadow either side of the gorge.\n\nAn ",{"type":"'''","value":["open ended ticket"]}," to the trail is ¥65 (as of April 2012) (¥25 for students ",{"type":"''","value":["under 25"]},") purchased from the ticket booths at either end of the trail. Some trekkers have avoided the entry fee by setting off early before the ticket booth opens or sneaking past when the guard is out.\n\nTypically the hike is spread over two days (one and half - three day) but a slower pace will afford you to time contemplate the natural surrounds and unwind in the villages quietude.\n\nThe trail stretches between Qiaotou and Walnut Grove, the more adventuresome types can continue to Daju or Baishuitai. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Maps"]}," showing distances and guesthouse locations are available from the ticket office.\n\nA little used side-trail to a remote waterfall just outside Walnut Garden is not shown on most maps but is marked with yellow arrows. The path is a challenging but worthwhile detour, passing through shady stands of bamboo to the base of the waterfall where the crashing water flows into a series of tranquil water pools.\n\nIf you prefer to visit without any (strenuous) hiking, a road along the south side of the gorge enters from the west and goes for a couple kilometers before stopping at a parking lot. After that there is a fairly level paved trail to Upper Tiger Leaping stone. Tours can be arranged in Lijiang or you can try to hire a driver to take you as a day trip from Lijiang, though drivers from Lijiang are not allowed to cross the river as that's outside their allowed territory.\n\nIf you want to avoid any hassles of figuring out your own transportation and directions you can go with a guide and a group from Lijiang for about ¥500 (covers transport, one night lodging, and any fees; no food).\n\nThere are a few ATMs in Qiaotou; however, they are only likely to take Chinese bank cards. The best idea would be to take the money you require for your time at Tiger Leaping Gorge from an ATM in Lijiang, to be on the safe side. There are no ATMs at any point along the trail.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Directions "]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Qiaotou"]]},":"]}," From the ticket office, walk along the road till you reach the school gate on your left. It's less than 1K from the bus station. There are blue and yellow signs that mark the start and most of the trail. Stay on the road, following the school's grey-white wall till its end where painted arrows point up an embankment at the beginning of the trek. From here keep to the well worn path and follow the plentiful painted red\/yellow arrows.\n\nA misleading fake path before the school forks off at a brick wall painted with fading arrows. People may tell you it is the right way, but stay on the road to the school. (If the road to the school is under construction you may have to take this one. Don't worry, you'll get to the right place eventually.)\n\nAbout 20km, and 7 hours, later at Tina's there is a trail down to the river. You can come back up to Tina's two ways - Tianti (the heavenly ladder), or Teacher Zhang's trail - or take a trail that goes a little ways down the river before coming back up a little farther down the road.\n\nFrom Tina's GH \/ Zhang GH, you can go down the middle gorge but each path cost 10¥ to use it. No combined ticket if you want to use both. Viewpoint from Zhang's GH has entrance fee of 2¥ \/ 5¥, which seems to be enforced only reluctantly. Once down in the gorge, turning left at the last hut before the Tiger Leaping Rock, you can continue downstream to Walnut Grove, along the river through an impressive cut along the sheer cliff.\n\nBus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lijiang"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shangrila"]]}," should be about ¥30. They start from north gate Lijiang and drop you off at Qiaotou.\n\nBuses to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lijiang"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shangrila"]]}," should be around ¥50. They depart from Tina's at 8AM, 1PM and 4PM. You will see signs along the hike advertising a ride from Sean's GH in Walnut Grove to Lijiang at 330PM. However, this bus does not run everyday and should not be relied upon if planning to hike from middle gorge to Walnut Grove.\n\nGet down to previous intersection if you want to check town and local market\nGet up to next crossing and turn right to reach entrance of the park (and the counter)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Annoyances "]},"\nSome locals in Lijiang will insist that this hike is dangerous, especially in rainy season.  You probably will not want to go when it is pouring, or if there has been a huge amount of recent rain due to the threat of landslides, but if it hasn't been that wet lately, and you find a couple of dry days and are reasonably experienced at hiking, the worst that will happen is that you will get muddy and have to ford a couple of swollen cascades.\n\nThe instant you step off the bus in Qiaotou touts will insist you take their mini-van to the ‘start of the trail’ (for ¥120+ one way) but they should be politely ignored. The real start of the trail is a 2 minute walk over the bridge and down the first road on the right.\n\nOn the trail there are endless efforts of varying legitimacy to help you part with your cash. At regular intervals old women, young girls and sundry others will demand small fees for using optional parts of the path. Some, such as the descent to the river below Tina's guest house, are particularly annoying, as you'll be asked for money at what seems like every step of the way, with an elaborate story to explain the cost. There is a 10 Yuan fee to hike down to the Tiger Leaping Stone, and another 10 Yuan fee if you choose to take the ladder trail back up. Locals will attempt to charge you fees to use the rocks as photo ops, but ignore them and take the trail to the building downstream, visible from the stream. The views are much better from there.\n\nNearing the most difficult part of the trail (the twenty-eight steep switchbacks), local men with horses or donkeys who will offer to take you part way for a fee. They will charge anywhere from ¥150-300, regardless of where on the trail you decide you want to use their services. If you feel the need to have the accomplishment of doing the hike on your own two feet, they can help you by taking your bag for about ¥50.\n\nSome guesthouses may try to mislead you about your hiking options. Tina's guesthouse has been known to insist that while you may descend to the river below, you must hike back up, and may not continue along the river to Walnut Grove - one of the most spectacular sections of the trail. While this part of the gorge has its charm, some feel it is not an essential part of the trek and could be skipped, though some emphatically disagree.\n\nHowever if you go out of season (Late March for example) many of the money collecting posts will be unattended and you'll be free to take advantage of the vistas without being harassed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Sleep and Eat "]},"\n\nNumerous family run guesthouses are conveniently dotted along the trail. Prices rise during the peak periods but outside of these times guesthouses are cheap and blissfully quiet. Qiaotou has a handful of comfortable hotels but there is little reason to stay.
