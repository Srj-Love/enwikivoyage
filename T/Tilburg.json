It started to grow during the Industrial Revolution, when wool factories were set up, thus making it the ",{"type":"''","value":["wool city"]}," of the Netherlands. Because wool was treated with urine during processing, employees had to bring along a full bottle to work every morning. This gave the Tilburgers their nickname of ",{"type":"''","value":["Kruikezeikers"]},". As of April 1, 2011, Tilburg has 206.186 inhabitants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nTilburg already existed in the late medieval period, when there was West-Tilburg and East-Tilburg (Which is now in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oisterwijk"]]},"). The lordship was known as Greater Tilburg, of which it was first Oisterwijk also with it, later it was Goirle. It was a part of the Bailiwick of 's-Hertogenbosch. Around the late 15th century, Tilburg contained a castle and Herd Places. These small places, streets with houses along it and agriculture between those streets formed the structure of which would once become the city of Tilburg.\n\nGoing further to the 18th century, slightly the first herd places became filled. In 1809, Louis Napoleon gave Tilburg city rights, after centuries of neglecting by the Dutch politics due to the catholic background of the city. However, the King William II, had found his nice place in Tilburg, and gave the mission to build a palace. Sadly, three weeks before completion in 1849, William II died. The palace is still standing as one of the few who survived the mayor Becht's destruction terror in the '60s.\n\nThe city expanded rapidly in the coming century, from being not much more than a village, to one of the largest cities in the Netherlands. The industrial revolution meant that hundreds of looms were standing in the city, filling the rest of the former herd places. Wool and textiles from Tilburg were very known at the first half of the 20th century. These times gave Tilburg the name of Kruikenzeikersstad (Jars-pissing-people city).\n\nAs the 2nd World War was over, Tilburg shortly retained this position until halfway the 1960s. Since then, the economy would implode, that did not happen due to government money to attract Tilburg for modern industries.\nMany monuments have not survived the renewal terror from Cees Becht in the 1960s. Beautiful historical buildings have made place for wider roads and gray flats. Also the train station was a historical one, but isn't anymore.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tourist Information"]},": VVV Tilburg, Nieuwlandstraat 34, 0900 2020815, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.vvvtilburg.nl"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nTilburg is connected to the rest of the country by a twice an hour Intercity service, bound to both Eindhoven - Venlo and Breda - Rotterdam - The Hague.\n\nA second intercity goes twice an hour from Flushing-Middelburg-Bergen op Zoom-Breda to Tilburg and goes further 's-Hertogenbosch-Nijmegen-Arnhem-Zwolle.
