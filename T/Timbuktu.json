Combined with its relative inaccessibility, \"Timbuktu\" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.\n\nToday, Timbuktu is an impoverished town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.

In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands. A program was set up to preserve the site and in 2005, it was taken off the list of endangered sites only to suffer immeasurable damage at the hands of Islamist militants in 2012 and early 2013, destroying an undetermined amount of the area's cultural heritage. \n\nIt was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special \"Wonders of the African World\". Gates visited with Abdel Kadir Haidara, curator of the Mamma Haidara Library together with Ali Ould Sidi from the Cultural Mission of Mali. It is thanks to Gates that an Andrew Mellon Foundation Grant was obtained to finance the construction of the library's facilities, later inspiring the work of the Timbuktu Libraries Project. Unfortunately, no practicing book artists exist in Timbuktu although cultural memory of book artisans is still alive, catering to the tourist trade. It is also home to an institute dedicated to preserving historic documents from the region.\n\nThe city itself is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arabic flair than of an African. The streets are made of sand (except one), and one has often to go down to get into the houses, because of the sand which has leveled the streets higher than the entrances of the houses.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Airport in Timbuktu.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Timbuktu airport"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nYou can come in a 12 to 24 hours trip by car from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mopti"]]}," or have a hard 4x4 experience from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gao"]]}," through the desert.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nYou can catch one of the many ",{"type":"'''","value":["tourist pinasses"]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mopti"]]}," (or slightly further downstream if the water level is low) they take 3 days to get there and are comfortable (at least mine was).
