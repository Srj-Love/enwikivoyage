[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Timeshares"]}," are a staple within the travel industry. A timeshare is a type of vacation lodging usually located on or near a resort facility. They are very similar to vacation condominiums, however, a timeshare is not sold as a single property. Instead timeshares are sold in weekly time slots or intervals and the timeshare unit is shared among potentially 52 different owners. Timeshares have been sold as fixed weeks, floating weeks, rotating weeks and most recently as vacation clubs or memberships as well as point based systems.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Travel accommodation"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinetopic"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Timeshare"]]}]
