The majority of buses and trolleys are new. The trams are old German models, but the travel conditions are quite decent. A major problem in Romanian public transportation is respecting a schedule. Unfortunately Timisoara makes no exception. Some of the tram and bus stations have digital panels which list the waiting times, but they're not always accurate. \n\nThere are two types of tickets, one for the three express lines (buses) and one for the rest of the buses, trams and trolleys. The prices for one ticket are around 0.6 and 0.3€ respectively, and you can find them at press stands in almost every station. You can also buy passes for a day, a week, two weeks or a month, on one, two or all lines.\n\nIn Timisoara there is no shortage of taxis. You can reach about any point in Timisoara by paying a fee of 15-50 Lei (about 3-12€). Don't negotiate with the driver and insist for the meter to be turned on. If you don't want to overpay avoid private taxis and call for a local taxi company (Tudo, Radio, Timisoara, Autogenn, Fan or Prompt). The taxis licensed by the City Hall have a distinctive oval black sticker on the backseat doors, while the pricier, probably scam taxis have a sign on the top of the car which only says 'Taxi' and doesn't mention the name of the taxi company. These taxis are twice as expensive, but they are also legal. If you see a taxi driver approaching and asking you for a ride, reject it, and search for a local company taxi.\n\nIf you want to rent a car there are plenty of car rental companies. They offer good priced services and all types of vehicles.\n\nGetting around the city is also possible by bicycle, and during rush hours with fair weather is far better than getting stuck in heavy traffic. There are also dedicated cycle lanes in some parts of the city (starting from the city center). However, be mindful of potholes popping up every now and then and be extra-cautious when sharing the road with cars, as some drivers tend to utterly disrespect anyone traveling on two wheels (be it a bicycle or a motorcycle).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Timisoara - The fish fountain.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["The Fish Fountain"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Timisoara-Union_Square.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Union Square"]]}," ‎\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Timisoara-the opera.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["The Opera-Victory Square"]]}," \n\nTimisoara is known in Romania as the City of Parks.
