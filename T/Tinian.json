(101.01 kmÂ²).\n\nTinian is the least populated of the three main Mariana Islands that constitute the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nA covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in political union with the United States of America formally defines the unique relationship between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States, as two separate but equal sovereign entities, recognizing ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"],["U.S."]]}," sovereignty but limiting in some respects the applicability of federal law.\n\nThe covenant was negotiated over the course of 27 months (December 1972 to February 1975) by the ",{"type":"''","value":["Marianas Political Status Commission"]}," (an organization representing the Northern Mariana Islands) and a delegation representing the United States. The proposed Covenant was signed by negotiators on 15 February 1975, in Saipan.\n\nSome covenant provisions became effective on 24 March 1976, the date of final approval. Remaining provisions took effect on 9 January 1978, and 4 November 1986, being the dates specified in Presidential proclamations. On the latter date, qualified residents of the Northern Mariana Islands became U.S. citizens. On 29 June 2009 U.S. Immigration Laws were to take effect; however, they were delayed until 28 November 2009.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe island has a strong historical legacy remaining from the Pacific war of the 1940s.\n\nTinian was a Protectorate of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," following World War I having been both a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"],["Spanish"]]}," and then a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"],["German"]]}," possession prior to coming under Japanese administration in 1914. Tinian was largely a sugar plantation area in the pre Pacific war period. Large-scale military construction began on Tinian in 1939, during the Japanese military buildup in the Pacific,.  1,200 prisoners of war were sent to the island from Japan for the construction of airfields as part of the defense of the Mariana Islands. By 1944, the island had three military airfields with a fourth under construction. What would latter become North Field under US control was originally a Japanese fighter airstrip of 4,380 ft (1,335 m) in length, it was originally built as Ushi Point Airfield.\n\nThe island was captured from the Japanese in July 1944 in the Battle of Tinian. Following a 13-day naval bombardment of Tinian leading up to the invasion at Unai Chulu, U.S. forces utilized napalm bombs against the Japanese. It was the first time napalm bombs were used during warfare. The US Marine landing force overcame the numerically superior Japanese force on 1 August 1944 in what is considered to be the best-executed amphibious landing operation of the war. US Marine casualties were 328 dead with 1,571 wounded. The Japanese lost 8,010 dead. Only 313 Japanese were taken prisoner, many Japanese service personnel and civilians were reported to have committed suicide rather than face capture. Several hundred Japanese troops held out in the jungles for months following the capture of the island. Following the conquest of the island Tinian subsequently became an important operational base for the rest of the Pacific war.\n\nThe exact figure is unknown however it is understood that approximately  5,000 ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korea"]]},"n civilian laborers died in the Marianas during the Pacific war. There is a small cluster of monuments on the island placed there in their memory.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:B-29s of the 462d Bomb Group West Field Tinian Mariana Islands 1945.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["B-29s of the 462d Bomb Group West Field Tinian Mariana Islands 1945"]]},"\n\nIn December 1944, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff made the decision that the newly captured islands in the Marianas in the central Pacific should have airfields built on them to support long range strategic bombing operations against the Japanese. Once under American control, a massive construction project was begun on the island in mid-August 1944.  The previous Japanese airfield sited there was repaired and considerably expanded, being named as West Field, or Gurguan Point Airfield due to its geographical location. West Field became operationally ready in the early spring of 1945, and the Twentieth Air Force XXI Bomber Command 58th Bombardment Wing was assigned there and initiated strategic bombardment operations directly against the Japanese Home Islands. After the Japanese surrender, groups of the 58th Bomb Wing dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners of war in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show of force missions. Beginning in September, the vast majority of its fleet of B-29 superfortreses were returned to the United States as part of \"Operation Sunset\". The 58th Bomb Wing returned to the United States on 15 November 1945, and its subordinate units were either inactivated or reassigned to other bases in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Okinawa"]]}," or returned to the United States.\n\nRebuilding the captured Japanese air strip at the north end of the island was one of the largest engineering projects of WWII. The massive engineering project created the largest airfield in the world at that time. Four vast 2,600 m runways assisted in the launching of 19,000 combat missions against Japan. With the departure of the USAAF, a part of the former wartime airfield has been used as a commercial airport and for general aviation use. The island is still considered an important strategic asset by the US to ensure the ongoing availability of a potential forward basing location in the Pacific. In 1983, a lease agreement covering these lands was signed and the United States DoD assumed control and possession over the northern two-thirds of Tinian. The lease agreement was for 50 years, with a renewal option for an additional 50 years. The United States Navy continues to utilise the Northwest Field area north of the airport for artillery training, and offers tours of the area when not being used for training.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Enola Gay2-PS.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["The Boeing B-29 Superfortress \"Enola Gay\" landing at Tinian after returning from the atomic bombing mission on Hiroshima, Japan"]]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Enola Gay"]}," was one of fifteen ",{"type":"''","value":["Silverplate"]}," B-29 strategic bomber aircraft assigned to the 393rd Bombardment Squadron of the 509th Composite Group of the XXI Air Force on Tinian Island during the Pacific war.

There are also minorities of East Asians and people of European descent. On Tinian, the Chamorro people speak English and Japanese.

The culture is a mix of original Chamorro culture with influences from 200 years of Spanish colonial rule and Japanese culture. The Spanish influence is seen not only from Catholicism but also from a somewhat modified form of the Cha-Cha-Cha dance. Japanese cultural influence can be still seen on Tinian through the presence of Japanese Shinto shrines.\t\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nLanguages spoken in the region are Philippine (Tagalog language), Chinese, Chamorro, English and mixed Pacific island languages.\n\nTinian Island is the new home to a Voice of America (VOA) radio relay station.
