If you arrive from London, the South and the South West of England, or South Wales, you will probably enter Tintern from the south via Chepstow. Vehicles from the Midlands and the North will probably come in from Monmouth. There is a height limit (of around 12 ft) on the A466 from Monmouth enforced by several miles of overhanging tree branches further up the road near Redbrook, and a weight limit imposed by a weak bridge across the Wye at Bigsweir. The valley is narrow and winding, with the result that the road is also narrow and winding.\n\nThere are also a number of footpaths in the area and a very minor (\"unclassified\") road from the west. It is therefore easy to enter and exit Tintern without using a motorised vehicle at all.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThere are several bus stops along the A466 as it passes through Tintern (which is built along the road). If you bring a car, Tintern Abbey has a large free car park. The village is small enough for all exploration to be done on foot - indeed, this is preferable, as most of the side roads are very narrow and the A466 is unsuited to roadside parking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Tintern Abbey"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.castlewales.com\/tintern.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The 12C Cistercian abbey has been in ruins since King Henry the 8th (the one with all those wives) dissolved the monasteries but it is still impressive after nearly 500 years.

The bridge over the river, which opened in 1906 and replaced a ferry (which promptly went bankrupt owing to an inevitable loss of custom), is particularly fine. It was built by the Wye Valley Railway, who also built the Wireworks bridge across the Wye in Tintern (although that is 30 years older); consequently they are both built in the same style.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Monmouthshire"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Tintern"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["51.69834"],["-2.67939"],["zoom=17"]]}]
