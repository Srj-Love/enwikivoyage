In the 1970s, Time magazine selected Tioman as one of the world’s most beautiful islands. The densely forested island is still sparsely inhabited. Also it is surrounded by numerous white coral reefs, making it a haven for scuba divers from around the region.\n\nAlready the most commercially developed of Malaysia’s eastern islands, a controversial RM 40 million marina project for Kampung Tekek, complete with 175 m cargo jetty, now threatens to speed up the pace of development on Tioman considerably. However, visitors with an aversion to such progress can avoid this part of the island and stay elsewhere without any impact.\n\nYou will find enormous monitor lizards across the island, sifting through the rubbish piles looking for food. There is also an abundance of domestic cats. \n\nRubbish control on the island is still in a development stage, apart from in some of the resorts.

The ferry operator tends to leave Mersing when the tide is high enough, when there are sufficient passengers aboard, or perhaps they are waiting for a connecting bus.

Sarcocystosis is not well known amongst physicians and is often mis-diagnosed. If you have flu-like symptoms and severe muscle aches after traveling to Tioman consult a tropical disease specialist immediately. Experimental treatment options with Cotrimoxazole and steroids are available. \n\nTheft is not generally an issue in private rooms. One thing to watch out for is coral cuts, which are bacteria-laden and turn septic very quickly if not treated in good time. Bring sterile wound wash and antiseptic cream for coral cuts; wash and treat them immediately to avoid a nasty infection. \n\nWatch out for the triggerfish as well; these little pointy-nosed fish are very cute but they do get territorial and attack swimmers during their mating season. The monkeys can be quite feral, and have been known to attempt to force open windows and doors to look for food, thanks to irresponsible tourists who insist on feeding the monkeys. \n\nSome young men (in their 20s) may invite female tourists to have drinks. If you're not interested, politely but firmly decline their offer.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["2.8167"],["104.1833"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["East Coast (Malaysia)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Tioman Island"]]}]
