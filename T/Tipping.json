Though by definition a tip is never legally required, and its amount is at the discretion of the one being served, for travellers it can cause some serious dilemmas. In some circumstances failing to give an adequate tip when one is expected to is a serious faux pas, and may be considered very miserly, a violation of etiquette, or unethical. In some other cultures or situations, giving a tip is not expected and offering one would be considered at best ",{"type":"'''","value":["odd"]}," and at worst ",{"type":"'''","value":["condescending or demeaning"]},". In some cultures it might be seen as a ",{"type":"'''","value":["bribe"]},", and in some circumstances (for example tipping government workers), tipping can even be ",{"type":"'''","value":["illegal"]},".\n\nIn most countries service personnel get paid enough to live on, and they do not have to rely on tips. While intentions are clearly good, (mostly North American) tourists are sometimes not aware of this, (or they know, but they just feel bad not tipping), and they export their generous behaviour to other countries where tipping is traditionally not customary, especially to tourist areas. Of course, this is quickly accepted (how would ",{"type":"'''","value":["you"]}," react if someone gave you extra money) and creates expectations that were not there before.\n\nIf you are tipping in a foreign country, ask yourself what that amount means for the one you are giving it to, not how much (or how little) it is for you. In some countries people occasionally get tipped a month's salary. While this definitely is cool for them, it can cause serious trouble. Think a waiter earning more than the chief of police...\n\nAnother problem is that, while tipping was originally intended to improve service, some employers use it to underpay workers with the expectation that tips will make up the difference. Good examples for this can be found in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Namibia"]]},", even at government-owned facilities. There is no guarantee the server even gets to keep the money; some employers may split tip revenue between large groups of workers (as a pretext to pay a lower wage to all of them) or, where legal safeguards are weak, even attempt to pocket a significant percentage for themselves.\n\nIn countries where tipping is not customary, attitudes towards the practice can differ. For instance, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]},", while tipping is generally not practised by the locals, it is still welcome (though not expected) by service staff should you decide to do so. On the other hand, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]},", tipping is seen as an insult, and attempting to do so could potentially offend your server.\n\nIn countries where tipping is expected (the US for example, where service personnel depend on it), complicated unofficial standards and customs have developed over the exact percentage to tip, and what should and should not be included in this calculation. In other countries and cultures the topic is way more relaxed. It is not easy for the traveller to know what to expect when they go to a foreign country. The idea of this article is to have some basic idea of the customs in other countries before you go there and embarrass yourself:\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Africa"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Central Africa"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Angola"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Central African Republic"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Democratic Republic of the Congo"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Equatorial Guinea"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Gabon"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Republic of the Congo"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["São Tomé and Príncipe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["South Sudan"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["East Africa"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Burundi"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Comoros"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Djibouti"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Eritrea"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Ethiopia"]},"\n\nIn Ethiopia tipping is common in hotels, restaurants and bars.

For services such as tour guides or translators, a tip of 20% or more is generally expected. Taxi drivers provide service based upon agreed prices rather than the more objective meter system used in some other countries, so tipping is not expected when using a taxi service, though tips are certainly accepted if offered.

It is less usual to tip in cafés and coffee shops. Many restaurants will allow tips to be added to a credit card bill, but it is generally considered better to leave cash at the table. The reason for this is that cash is deemed to have been given to the waiting staff directly, whilst credit card payments and cheques are legally payable to the restaurant. While a tip given by credit card or cheque will almost always be passed on to the waiting staff, it is legal for restaurants to pay their staff less than the minimum wage if the amount given in tips via the restaurant management augments their wages to the level of the minimum wage.\n\nIt is not normal to tip for drinks in a pub or bar, although offering to buy the bar tender a drink is considered acceptable and they may also then take money for the value of a drink (which is in effect taking a tip.  Commonly, this is offered by saying \"and one for yourself\" at the time of payment. In cases where the pub is also a restaurant, the serving staff may be tipped.\n\nIn many table-service restaurants - and 'gastro pubs' - a 'service charge' is added to the bill, usually (but not always) when the party exceeds a certain size e.g. six, in which case there is no expectation to tip further.  It's worth checking the menu when ordering, for information on service charges.\n\nIt is a legal requirement to post prices including any taxes and other charges. Additional service charges at restaurants are unusual. Where these occur, it is legal to refuse to pay the service charge but people only tend to do this if they believe the service was inadequate.\n\nHistorically, offering a tip may have been seen as an insult; it is implying the receiver may be bought or bribed, and that the person doing the tipping is \"better than you\". This is the origin of the custom of offering to buy the barman\/barmaid a drink in a pub. You would not tip a friend or work colleague, that would be an insult, but it is normal to buy them a drink.  These attitudes have now largely given way.\n\nIn some establishments, tips are kept individually by the waiter or waitress, whereas in others they may be pooled and divided amongst all the staff (a ",{"type":"'''","value":["'tronc"]},"'). In other instances, tips may be set aside for some other purpose for the benefit of the staff, such as to fund a staff party or trip.\n\nTipping for other services such as taxis and hairdressers is not expected, but tips are sometimes given to reward particularly good service. Although in some large cities it is customary to tip both taxi drivers and hairdressers\/barbers.  In taxis, it is common to round up the fare to the nearest whole pound, even if that means a derisory tip of 10p.  If, for example, the fare is £4.90, it is common to say \"make it £5.00, just to make it easier\".\n\nAttempting to tip a policeman, fireman, nurse, doctor or other public-sector worker is prohibited and very rarely attempted; in the case of the police, it may be considered attempted bribery and, at best, will be met by bafflement on the part of the officer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["North America"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bermuda"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Canada"]},"\nTipping in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}," is similar to that in the United States due to the close cultural nature of the two countries but tends to be somewhat lower due to higher minimum wages and publicly-funded medical care. Restaurant wait staff in Canada typically receive about 10-15% on the before-tax total. Tipping is not appropriate in cafeterias, fast food establishments and takeaway stands; one is not normally expected to tip hotel chamber maids.\n\nWhile tipping was originally intended as a means to reward above-average service, there is now an attitude of entitlement in most sit-down restaurants, bars, hotel room service operations, barber shops and taxi companies. Don't be surprised if the local pizzeria which claimed \"free delivery\" in all of their advertising sends someone who has one hand out for a tip the moment they arrive at your doorstep or wants to keep the change.\n\nSome provinces (including Quebec and Ontario) allow employers to pay lower minimum wages to workers who would reasonably be expected to be receiving tips. Employers routinely abuse this privilege by splitting all tip revenue among large groups of workers, each of which may then be paid badly in the expectation that the customer is somehow expected to make up the difference. The restaurant won't disclose to the client that their individual server doesn't get to keep that entire tip. Large groups and clients paying by credit card should be particularly wary as it is not unheard of for a bar or restaurant to tack a generous 15% tip onto a bill themselves - sometimes even in buffet-style establishments where the clients are expected to serve themselves. \n\nThere are also tax considerations; if the restaurant admitted that extra 15% was part of the base price, those dollars would start getting hit with Canada's notorious double-digit sales taxes. Governments are also prone to make broad assumptions about tips for income tax purposes (if you bill a fat tip in Ontario to a credit card, the tax man assumes the server's cash clients were just as lavishly generous; in Québec, the government may blindly presume the servers rake in 15% tips on every transaction - even if the meal was served an hour late and stone cold). That tends to go over poorly with individual servers, especially since the unemployment insurance payout if the restaurant closes is based on the (sub-minimum wage) base pay only.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Greenland"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mexico"]},"\n\nTipping in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]}," is similar to the United States.

Standards vary, but gratuities are always given to servers in restaurants and bars, to taxi drivers, parking valets, and bellstaff in hotels, and should be omitted only in extreme cases of bad service. The salaries made in these professions, and even their taxes, take into account that they will be tipped, so it really is inappropriate to leave them out.\n\nTipping managers and business owners is almost always inappropriate, unless you are the host of a large party, wedding, or event. Even then, be careful how you present the tip—it's best to offer a percent of the total bill to the person in charge (usually the head caterer) and to subtly thank them for sharing it with their staff.\n\nTipping in the United States is so common and expected in some cases that in many service establishments, such as hair salons and restaurants, customers who did not tip are often asked to pay a tip, or more rarely may be verbally scolded or abused by staff for \"stiffing\" them, even though such behavior on the part of the staff is considered clearly inappropriate.\n\nTipping can work ",{"type":"''","value":["for"]}," you, if you are savvy. While it is usually presented as an expected part of payment, it can also be a subtle (and acceptable) bribe for preferential treatment. This is especially true with hotel staff and with bartenders. Unusually large tips can also be a good strategy for securing preferential treatment in the future, if you plan to go to the same place often. Tipping well also makes you look rather good in front of friends, dates, and business partners (and the reverse is true for tipping poorly).\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Restaurants"]},"\n\nTipping is customary in restaurants offering table service. Understand that the custom is so usual here that US restaurant waitstaff are typically paid less than the local minimum wage by their employers (and are given legal exception to do so) -- the waiters often rely on customers' tips to make a living wage.\n\nWhile the amount of a tip is at the discretion of the patron, the customary tip has risen in recent years from the long usual 15% to around 18% before tax (many tip 20%, since it's easier to calculate, but that is more than expected in most places).  It is usual to leave more for particularly pleasing service, and somewhat less for service on the poor side.\n\nWhen a server has not adequately addressed issues a customer has with service, the patron may ask to speak with a manager to have the problems corrected before considering reducing the tip. In extreme cases of inferior service, the patron may choose not to leave a tip—travelers who have the misfortune to experience particularly bad service should consider leaving a small coin (a quarter dollar or less) to make the point that the tip was not simply forgotten.\n\nIn certain situations, restaurants may include a mandatory tip (service charge), usually around 18%. Reputable restaurants post their policy on a sign or the menu, or require servers to inform their patrons of such charges before they order. This is most common for large groups, such as six or more. This charge can be verified by the customer on the bill to avoid tipping in addition to the service charge.  Rarer reasons for a service charge can occur if the customer was especially rude, is not likely to leave a tip, or is too intoxicated to notice. A customer may choose to include an extra tip for the server over and above the service charge, or, if service is poor, to negotiate an alternate service charge with management.\n\nTipping on wine with a meal requires some discretion and judgment, as many restaurants mark up their wine 200 to 400%. Some suggest a tip of 18% on the meal before tax, and 10% on the wine, especially if the total wine bill is near or exceeds the cost of the meal, although some may counsel that this is being cheap.\n\nMany traditional restaurants offer carry-out (\"pick-up,\" \"take-out, or \"curbside\") service, and standards for tipping for such services vary. Tipping is not required for non-table services. It's nice to leave a tip in the case of exceptional service or difficult orders, or simply to show your generosity. Tipping at fast food restaurants and coffeehouses that do not offer table service is not necessary, regardless of whether there is a \"tip jar.\" When eating at a counter (most likely in a diner), you should always tip your server as you would for standard table service.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Bars"]},"\n\nTipping bartenders is universal. You should tip at the end of the night if running a tab, but if you are paying cash for each round (and taking the drinks back to a table or friends), it's a good idea to leave a cash tip each time—you'll get better and more attentive service on a busy night, and may well get stiffer drinks.\n\nThe size of the tip varies on the type of establishment. In a cheap place, one dollar per drink, or one dollar per every two drinks, is common, but if you are in a classier place paying around $7–8 or above per drink, two per drink, or even more in a high-class bar (or if you especially like the bartender's service). If you run a tab in a nicer-than-your-average-bar and are paying at the end, you should go back to the standard 15-20% rule.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Hotels"]},"\n\nTips are common, and rules sometimes complex, at nicer hotels. Motels, cheap hotels, and bed & breakfasts are generally not places for tips outside of restaurants and bars.\n\nParking valets, room service, and bellmen should always be tipped for carrying luggage and for delivering items to rooms (food, boxes, faxes). With room service, though, double check whether the hotel has already added a service charge. Bellmen should always receive at least $2 for carting your luggage, but should receive more if you have a lot of luggage. Housekeeping staff are customarily tipped one or more dollars per day, which you can just leave on the table. The front desk staff should be tipped only for very unusual and exceptional services. It is inappropriate to tip managers or owners.\n\nThe rules for tipping concierge are much more arcane. For most services—asking for maps, information, tours, etc.—a tip is not expected. But for things above and beyond like special, unusual, time-consuming requests, if you receive a lot of attention while others are waiting, or even just for an exceptionally high level of service, tips should generally be large, usually starting at $5 (a $1 tip would be insulting). Tips can be a good way to get special treatment during a stay too: good-sized preemptive tips for restaurant reservations could lead to special preferential treatment at the restaurant, tips can make unusual or difficult requests happen when the concierge would otherwise demur, tips out-of-the-blue can lead to special service throughout your stay, etc.\n\nIf you especially like the service you have received from an employee during a stay, consider passing them a larger tip ($5 or more) on the way out.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Taxis"]},"\n\nMost U.S. guides recommend 15-20% of the fare.

With this in mind, many Colombians will pay the bill without the tip (in cash or with credit card) and then hand a cash tip to the staff member (waiter, bartender, etc.) who served them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Ecuador"]},"\n\nBars, restaurants and hotels include a 10% service charge in the bill, so tipping is not required. In the case of restaurants, it is customary to leave some spare change in reward for good service. Some restaurants will include a small piece of paper along with the bill, in which the client can specify a tip if they are paying with credit card.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Falkland Islands"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["French Guiana"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Guyana"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Paraguay"]},"\n\nService charges are included with the bill, and tipping is uncommon.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Peru"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Suriname"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Uruguay"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Venezuela"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Islands of the Atlantic Ocean"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Islands of the Indian Ocean"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["British Indian Ocean Territory"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Christmas Island"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Cocos Islands"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinetopic"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Concerns"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Tip (gratuity)"]]}]
