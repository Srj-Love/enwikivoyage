[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hitchhiking"]}," is one of the cheapest ways of traveling.  By tradition, hitchhiking is defined as soliciting a ride by standing at the edge of a road, facing traffic, with one's thumb extended\/upwards.  You can meet a lot of people and make lots of friends.  You can also become very frustrated, or encounter danger on the way; today's drivers are more fearful of picking up hitchhikers than in the past.  But it's also a great feeling to get a ride after you've been waiting for a long time.  People who do pick up hitchhikers tend to be very friendly.  However, hitchhikers also risk being picked up by someone who is an unsafe driver or even  dangerous to their person.\n\nHitchhiking in itself is rarely illegal, but there are often rules about ",{"type":"''","value":["where"]}," you can do it (e.g. not on highways, near intersections, at bus stops), so read up on the rules first to avoid getting booked for \"trespassing\" or \"obstructing traffic\".\n\nThere is a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/hitchwiki.org\/en\/Main_Page Hitchhiking Wiki"]},", which has quite a lot of useful information.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Before"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Be prepared to walk all day.

If you attempt this, be aware of when a border is buffered by a militarized \"no-man's land,\" through which it is illegal to cross on foot or camp, making it crucial to find a ride within this few-hundred-meter stretch of road before dark.

Also, walking away from town may put you in an inhospitable environment such as a desert, and be counter-productive.
