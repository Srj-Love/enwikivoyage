In some parts of the world, such as Europe and much of Asia, it's still one of the standard modes of city-to-city travel, and in others (e.g. North America) it remains as a fairly popular alternative.

It's also more comfortable than air travel, especially to those who don't like the thought of being suspended 30,000 feet above the ground.  For distances between about 100 and 800 km it may be the fastest method of travel, especially if you need to go from city center to city center.
