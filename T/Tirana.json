His first constructions were a mosque, a bakery and a hamam (Turkish bath). On February 8, 1920 Tirana was made the temporary capital by the Congress of Lushnje, and it was proclaimed the permanent capital on December 31, 1925.\n\nTourists usually find Tirana a beautiful and charming city, with a lively night life. However, Tirana suffers from pollution problems mainly due to the rapid increase in cars in the city and continuous construction. Long gone are the days when Tirana used to be subject to power outages almost daily and this made Tirana a noisy city as the lack of power and lack of traffic lights had cars navigating by honking their horns.\n\nToday the situation has dramatically improved regarding power outages. Tirana is undergoing a major renovation from its communist days. Many of the ugly dull buildings have been repainted, but a lot of work is left to be done. The average citizen speaks little English and Italian.\n\nThe main business and entertainment area (not by coincidence) has become \"The Block\" (Blloku) which is the area where in the past, the communist leaders used to live under strict protection. Locals prefer to hang out at the many cafes and main parks. A popular retreat is by cable car to Mount Dajti where one can get a panoramic view of the city from above.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourist information office"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=Rruga Ded Gjo Luli"],["lat=41.33002"],["long=19.81637"],["directions=just north of Skanderbeg Square (behind the National Historic Museum)"],["phone="],["fax="],["hours=open M-F 11.00-16.00 (as of 2013)"],["price="],["content=The English-speaking staff are very helpful and can provide maps and directions to hostels\/hotels etc. Also free copies of \"Tirana in your pocket\" guide, which includes vital information about bus and furgon schedules."]]},"  "]},{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["image=Terminal jashte.jpg"],["name=Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza"],["alt=Rinas International Airport ",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TIA"]]}],["url=http:\/\/www.tirana-airport.com"],["email="],["address=Airport Rd Rinas"],["lat=41.4159"],["long=19.7138"],["directions=17 km from the centre of town. - - ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/rinasexpress.com Rinas Express"]}]}," operates an hourly bus between 6AM and 6PM from the airport to Skanderberg Square and vice versa.
