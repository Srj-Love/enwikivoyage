Strictly, the name refers to the water palace built here in 1946 by the King of Karangasem.

The one hectare complex was built in 1946 by the late King of Karangsem but was destroyed almost entirely by the eruption of nearby Mount Agung in 1963. It has been lovingly re-built and restored and has an air of authentic royal magnificence. The centrepiece of the palace is an eleven tiered fountain, and there are many beautiful carvings and statues adorning the gardens. This is a great spot to unwind and it has a real atmosphere of old Bali. You can bathe in the pools for a small charge which is additional to the Rp 20,000 (foreigners) entrance fee.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Tirta_Gangga_Rice_Paddies.jpg"],["thumb"],["300 px"],["right"],["Rice paddies north of Tirta Gangga"]]},"\n\nThe area around Tirta Gangga holds some stunning ",{"type":"'''","value":["rice paddy terraces"]},".

This is one of the key nine directional temples on the island. Park in the car park and walk up the steps to the temple. The lower temple is always open but the upper temple (at the top of the dragon staircases) is often locked, so it is best to go with a Balinese driver who will usually be able to arrange for the temple priest to open it up for you. It's situated high up a mountain and there are magnificent sunset views at dusk.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Taman Ujung"]}," to the southeast of Karangasem (Amlapura) is another water palace built by the predecessor of the King who constructed Tirta Gangga. It must be said that it is rather inferior, but still a charming attraction and worth a visit. Taman Ujung was built in 1909 as a relaxation and recreation palace by the then King of Karangasem, I Gusti Bagus Jelantik. It was largely destroyed by the eruption of Mount Agung in 1963, damaged again by an earthquake in 1979, and has not been restored on the same scale as Tirta Gangga. You do get a sense of how lovely it must have been though.  From Tirta Gangga, head back south to Karangasem and then take the minor road south east to the village of Ujung.  Taman Ujung is another 2 km past the village, very close to the coast.
