They sought the help of Lord Shiva to judge who was really superior; Lord Shiva grew into a long flaming light stretching between earth and heaven, and asked them to find root and crown.\n\nBrahma agreeing to reach the crown took the form a swan and flew, and flew to an extending height and could not reach the crown. In his upward flight he caught hold of a flower of Pandavas falling from Shiva's crown and requested the flower to bear a false witness that he collected it from Shiva's crown . Knowing this Lord Shiva cursed Brahma that he would never be worshipped in the temple, and banished Pandavas flower from his adornment.\n\nLord Vishnu took the form of pig and kept digging down to reach Siva's foot; Shiva was really pleased with the humility of Vishnu and took him his heart.The significance of Shiva's representation as agni over here is to convey the divine message \"To be blessed with true knowledge, there should be a complete destruction of the ego.\"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe Arunachaleshwara temple for Lord Shiva was built between the 16th and the 17th centuries by the kings of the Vijayanagara empire.

The temple hosts several cultural, religious and literary events. \n\nIn addition to the Arunachaleswara temple, there are nine small \"Shivalayams\" (Lord Shiva temples) along the Girivalam path, each representing the \"navagrahas\". About 7 km from the Arunachaleswara temple is \"Adi Annamalai\" (அடி அண்ணாமலை), a large temple. This temple was built before the Arunachaleswara temple. \"Ner Annamalai\" (நேர் அண்ணாமலை), which is located exactly halfway along the Girivalam path is also a site of interest. From one of the sites along the Girivalam path, a part of the mountain looks like \"Nandi\" (head of a cow). There are display signs for this: Nandi Darisanam(நந்தி தரிசனம்). \n\nThe town is home to Ramanar Ashram and Kandha Ashram (both situated just outside the town).

There are 8 lingams one in each direction , 360 holy tanks, mandapas and ashrams around the Arunachala hill.  Every month on full moon day, scores of people travel to the town for \"girivalam\".

The path is well lit at night and is equipped with sanitation facilities. On regular days, people also go around the mountain on vehicles. On full moon days and during the 10-15 days of Karthigai Deepam festival, however, vehicular traffic is blocked. Best time to walk around the mountain is early morning and in the evening after daylight. At least 10 lakh (1 million) people do girivalam on full moon days.\n\nKarthigai Deepam festival, the most important festival for the town, is celebrated during the months of Nov\/Dec (full moon day of the Tamil month, Karthigai). The most important event of the festival is lighting a \"Deepam\" (a large lamp made with several litres of ghee and a several-meter-long cotton wick) at 6 pm on the full moon day of Karthigai month. The light can be seen from several towns\/villages within a 30 km diameter. Millions visit the town on the day to do \"girivalam\" and \"climb\" the mountain. The town literally lights up with fireworks all over. The festival begins 10 days before and concludes 3 days after the full moon day. The \"deepam\" burns for at least a week.
