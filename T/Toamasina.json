Not too far from the Joffre Boulevard. Staff is friendly, there is air conditioning and hot water and clean sheets. Expect to find some cockroaches and some insects about in your room. One of the advantage (or disadvantage, depending on you) is that these insects attract a number of geckos around, making for some interesting sights. The air conditioning will most likely smell of cigarettes but you can expect it to work. Also, turning on the air conditioning will prevent mosquitoes to enter your room. Rooms are around 50,000 Ariary (25$) with Air Conditioning. There is cheap breakfast available in the morning but choices are very limited.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Melville Hotel"]},": A small hotel recently renovated on the Melville Boulevard. Air conditioning and hot water available. Very cheap (30,000 ariary per night) though the rooms are quite small and not very isolated.
