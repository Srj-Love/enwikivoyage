The raisin-like, botrytised grapes (aszú berries) are picked one by one, traditionally in 25 kg hods (puttony). The aszú grapes (usually 3 to 6 hods) are added to a base wine usually still in fermentation, the traditional measuring unit of which is the Gönc cask (136 l). The number of hods of aszú grapes added to 136 litres of base wine determines the concentration of the aszú wine (3 to 6 Puttonyos, or Aszú Eszencia if even more concentrated).
