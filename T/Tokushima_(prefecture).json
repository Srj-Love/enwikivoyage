Naruto Kintoki can be prepared in numerous ways and are also used for brewing Shochu (Japanese Liquor). For those eating it for the first time, try it plain in order to sense its qualities with no distractions. One way to do so is by wrapping the potato tightly in foil and letting it bake in the oven till it softens.
