As a general rule of thumb, Tokyo Metro lines are cheapest, Toei lines are most expensive, and JR lines fall somewhere in the middle (but are usually cheaper than Metro for short trips, i.e. no more than 4 stations). Many of the private lines interoperate with the subways, which can occasionally make a single ride seem unreasonably expensive as you are in essence transferring to another line and fare system, even though you're still on the same train.  E.g. changing between Metro subway line and Tokyu private line amounts to paying the sum of each fare: minimum fare Metro ¥160 + minimum fare Tokyu ¥120 = ¥280.  In addition, several patterns of transfer are listed as \"Transfer Discount\", and the most famous one is ¥70 discount, that applies to a transfer between Tokyo Metro and Toei subway lines. When using Suica or PASMO, you can get all transfer discounts automatically. At some transfer stations, you may need to pass through a special transfer gate (both for paper tickets and PASMO\/Suica) which is coloured orange – passing through the regular blue gate will not get you your transfer discount and if you have a paper ticket, you won't get it back. At some transfer points (e.g. Asakusa station) you may actually need to transfer on street level as the two stations (Metro Ginza Line and Toei Asakusa Line) are not physically connected and are about one block apart.\n\nIt pays to check your route beforehand.

Most vending machines will let you buy a single ticket that covers a transfer between JR, subway and private lines, all the way to your destination, but working out how to do this may be a challenge if you are not familiar with the system.  When transferring between systems, whether paying with tickets or smart cards, use the ",{"type":"'''","value":["orange transfer gates"]}," to exit.  Otherwise, you'll be charged full fare for both separate parts of your trip, instead of the cheaper transfer fare.\n\nMost train lines in Tokyo run from around 05:00 to 01:00. During peak hours they run about once every three minutes; even during off-peak hours it's less than ten minutes between trains. The only night when regular passenger services run overnight is for the New Year's Holiday on select lines.\n\nFor additional information for train travel in Japan generally, refer to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan#By rail"],["By rail"]]}," section in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," article.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Honjo taxi 2007-01.jpg"],["200px"],["thumb"],["A typical Tokyo taxi"]]},"\nTaxis are very pricey, but may be a value for groups of three or more.

A 20% night surcharge is tacked on from 22:00-05:00. As a rule of thumb, a daytime trip across the city from Tokyo station to Shinjuku station will cost approximately ¥3000, while a daytime trip from Tokyo station to Haneda Airport costs around ¥6200. These examples are based on standard routing and traffic conditions, so your actual fare may vary in relation to the estimated fare.\n\nTaxi rear left passenger doors are operated by the driver and open and close automatically. Don't open or close them yourself.\n\nDo not count on your taxi driver speaking English—or knowing more than the best-known locations, though most taxis have GPS \"car navi\" systems installed.  The best and easiest thing to do is to prepare a map marked with where you want to go, and point it out on the map to the taxi driver. If you are staying at a hotel, they will provide a map. If possible, get a business card, or print out the address in Japanese of any specific places you wish to go.  However, because in Japan streets are often unmarked, if the taxi driver does not have GPS he may not be able to do more than take you to the general vicinity of where you want to go.

In this city with such an excellent mass transit system, you would need a good reason to want to drive around instead.  While renting a car can make sense in Japan in some contexts (e.g., visiting a rural onsen resort), in general it is neither convenient nor economical to rent a car to get around metro Tokyo.  Taxis are much more convenient if your budget allows it; walking or public transportation is much less expensive and given the difficulties of navigation and finding parking in popular areas, probably easier too.\n\nIf you do decide to plunge in and drive around by car, the main expressway serving Tokyo is the Shuto Expressway, abbreviated to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Shutoko"]}," (首都高) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.shutoko.jp\/english\/"]},".

If you use a \"Suica\" or \"PASMO\" card to board a Toei Bus, you will receive a ¥100 discount on your next Toei Bus ride as long as it is within 90 minutes of the previous ride. Compared to the trains, the buses run much less frequently, carry fewer passengers, and are much slower. This makes them amenable to the elderly residents of Tokyo, but rather inconvenient for travelers, who will also have to deal with lack of information in English and sometimes very well hidden bus stops. Bus routes can be fairly complicated and are often not listed in detail at the bus stops; signs on the buses themselves often list only two or three main stops in addition to the origin and destination. Inside the bus the next stop is usually announced several times, sometimes by a taped voice and sometimes by a mumbling driver.
