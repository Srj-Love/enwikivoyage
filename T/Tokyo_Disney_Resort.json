Tokyo Disneyland's sister park ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tokyo DisneySea"]}," (東京ディズニーシー), which opened in September 2001, is an ocean-themed park exclusive to Japan.

After three years, ZED had ended after its last performance in December 31, 2011.\n\nTokyo Disney Resort is something different from all the other Disney parks. People are more friendly, but you notice all the time that you are in the largest city on Earth when you are wandering, amazed at the fantastic shows and rides in both parks, as it is very crowded and you can expect huge queues even for the smallest attraction on a normal day.\n\nThis is no Walt Disney World; in other words, it is small and can be easily tackled in about two or three days, maybe more. Still, whatever effort you place into coming here is well worth it if you like Disney stuff.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nJapanese is the primary language spoken here. However, assistance for English speakers is also widely available, because of the presence of American and other foreign cast members. Chinese and Korean are also spoken to a lesser extent. Still, English is not very popular in Japan, even here.\n\nDo not expect all cast members (ride attendants) to speak English.  Most communication when getting on and off rides is done by finger symbols, which seem to be standardised across all attractions.\n\nMaps are available in Japanese, English, Korean, and Chinese. (The English map will work fine.) All the maps do a very good job of letting you know how to get around. The Japanese maps, however, are a little bit more informative. They include highlights on some of the special events going on in the park, including special food menus and merchandise, most of which can be had for only a limited amount of time. \n\nThey also sort the restaurants, shops and shows into different categories. If you know katakana, hiragana, and a little bit of kanji, this might also be a helpful resource. Nearly any park attendant should have maps available if you lose your map or forget to pick one up.\n\nSome rides like the Jungle Cruise are rendered almost meaningless to non-Japanese speakers. You can try and laugh along to avoid embarrassment if you like. Some other attractions, like MicroAdventure! (known as \"Honey, I Shrunk The Audience\" at Disney's American parks) have English translations with headphones in the back row: make sure you get to the front of the queue or you may miss out on yours.\n\nSpecial stage shows may be entirely in Japanese, entirely in English, or in a mixture of both. It is difficult to ascertain what language a show will be in or whether translations are provided before you get to see it.

And, the people-watching is great.\n\nIf you can, it is a good idea to get a map ahead of time and plan out what rides and attractions you would like to get to first. Like any other large amusement park, Tokyo Disney Resort can be quite crowded. Even on weekdays, there can be a large amount of people in the park and if you want to maximize your experience, it's best to have at least an idea of what you would like to do before you get there.

Simply insert your ticket into a machine at the ride, and you'll get a FastPass ticket with a return time printed on it.

You can have only one FastPass at a time, you can't FastPass another ride until two hours after you received your last FastPass. It's a good idea to always get your next FastPass when it becomes available. If you wish to use FastPass, you need to do so as early as possible.

When you make a Priority Seating booking, you will receive a designated time to return to the restaurant, and you will then be seated with a minimal wait. Note that waiting times may vary, especially during peak periods.  \n\nKeep in mind that Priority Seating bookings will be held for no more than 15 min past your designated time frame for a restaurant in either of the two theme parks and no more than 10 min for a restaurant in any one of the three Disney Hotels. Also, that capacity is limited and bookings tend to fill up early, and that there may be times when Priority Seating bookings are not available. \n\nPriority Seating can be booked in person at each applied restaurant, or through the Tokyo Disney Resort Reservation Center at +81-45-683-3333. If you know how to read Japanese, you can also make Priority Seating reservations online using the resort's Japanese website.\n\nPriority Seating is accepted at the following in-park restaurants:\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Tokyo Disneyland"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Blue Bayou Restaurant (Adventureland)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Eastside Cafe (World Bazaar)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Restaurant Hokusai (World Bazaar)"]},"\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Tokyo DisneySea"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Magellan's (Mediterranean Harbor)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Restaurant Sakura (American Waterfront)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Ristorante di Canaletto (Mediterranean Harbor)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Sailing Day Buffet (American Waterfront)"]},{"type":"*","value":["SS ",{"type":"''","value":["Columbia"]}," Dining Room (American Waterfront)"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["At Ikspiari"]},"\nIkspiari has a broad range of dining options, one of which is Japan's only ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rainforest Cafe"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nMost drinks are soft drinks.
