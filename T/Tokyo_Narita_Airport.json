The airport is generally modern and efficient, but sometimes overcrowded, particularly at immigration.

Foreign airlines operate out of either terminal, with Japanese carriers ANA and JAL operating out of terminals 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nThe Terminal 1 South Wing houses most airlines in the Star Alliance (e.g. ANA, Asiana Airlines, United, Air Canada). Most carriers in Skyteam (e.g. Air France, China Southern, Delta, KLM, Korean Air) operate out of the Terminal 1 North Wing, and OneWorld airlines (e.g. JAL, American, British Airways, Finnair) operate out of Terminal 2.

Reservations are required but can be purchased just before boarding if there is space (and there usually is).  If there is no space, JR will sell standing tickets for ¥500 less.\n\nThe regular fare starts at ¥3,020 for trips from Narita Airport to Tokyo Station in standard class, with higher fares for green car (first class) seats.

Note that this discounted ticket is not valid for return travel to Narita, nor is it valid for green cars in any direction - in these instances the full fare will have to be paid.\n\nJR also operates Rapid trains on the Sobu\/Narita line, leaving once per hour and stopping at various points along the way, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chiba"]]},". These are normal, non-smoking commuter trains and often get crowded during rush hour (though boarding at Narita Airport should not be a problem, and seats can be easily obtained). To Tokyo the trip is approximately 82 minutes, but at a cost of ¥1,320 you may as well pony up a few hundred yen for the Narita Express using the N'EX Tokyo Direct Ticket. The Rapid service train also has a couple of green cars; a seat can be obtained for ¥980 (¥780 on a holiday) if reserved beforehand, with higher fares charged on board. Fares charged before boarding are deducted from an IC card such as Suica.\n\nIf you have a voucher for a JR pass, then you should exchange it here at the JR ",{"type":"''","value":["View Plaza"]}," Travel Service Center (Regular JR ticket counter when the ",{"type":"''","value":["View Plaza"]}," is closed), as the Narita Express is free with a Japan Rail Pass.

Both routes connect to Tokyo's Keisei Ueno and Nippori stations; the two lines branch off separately between Airport Terminal 2 Station and Takasago Station. Nippori offers the easiest connection to the JR Yamanote and Joban Lines, and to the Nippori-Toneri Liner for Tokyo's Adachi Ward. At Keisei Ueno you can walk over to JR Ueno station in 4 minutes to connect to the JR Yamanote, Tohoku and Takasaki lines and northbound Shinkansen trains, as well as the Ginza and Hanzomon subway lines. \n\nBecause the Sky Access and Keisei Main Lines operate on different fare structures, separate ticket gates and platforms are used at Narita Airport's two train stations. Sky Access Line passengers only have to pass through one ticket gate, while Keisei Main Line passengers must pass through two ticket gates. Taking a train through the Sky Access route between the Airport and Nippori\/Ueno is ¥1,240 (on top of the basic fare), while the Keisei Main Line route is ¥1,030. The whole fare can be paid using a Suica card.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Sky Access Line"]},"\nKeisei's premier service is the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.keisei.co.jp\/keisei\/tetudou\/skyliner\/us\/index.html Skyliner"]}]},", which operates on the Sky Access Line 2-3 times per hour.

The new Skyliner trains offer comfortable seating and a maximum speed of 160 km\/h (100 mph). The full run from Terminal 1 to Ueno takes 44 minutes, with the train traveling nonstop between Nippori and Terminal 2 in 36 minutes. All seats are reserved and the regular fare is ¥2,470 each way, though foreign tourists can take advantage of a discount using the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.keisei.co.jp\/keisei\/tetudou\/skyliner\/e-ticket\/en\/ticket\/91\/ Skyliner eTicket"]}]},". Using this service you can purchase Skyliner ticket vouchers in advance for only ¥2,200, and print your vouchers to be exchanged for tickets in Japan at a manned Keisei or Skyliner ticket counter. When exchanging your voucher you must present your passport and will be asked for your desired departure time.\n\nThe budget option along the Sky Access Line is the commuter train service known as Access Express, or Access Tokkyu (アクセス特急). Access Tokkyu trains depart every 40 minutes, and most daytime trains run into the Toei Asakusa Subway Line (from 4\/5PM, only to Ueno). Making limited stops, the Access Tokkyu offers the best ride to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo\/Asakusa"],["Asakusa"]]}," (65 minutes, ¥1,280) and Nihombashi (70 minutes, ¥1,320). Shimbashi (75 minutes, ¥1,320) puts you within easy reach of the Yurikamome light rail line to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo\/Odaiba"],["Odaiba"]]},". A change of trains at Nihombashi will allow you to make a quick hop into the Ginza district (Higashi-Ginza Station, 80 minutes, ¥1,320).

Other times, you will be required to transfer at Aoto; the connecting train a local service; this increases travel time to 80-90 minutes. During these hours, it is better to take the Mainline Limited Express directly to Ueno (81 minutes), and save ¥210.\n\nFrom the Access Tokkyu trains you can transfer at Imba-Nihon-Idai station - two stations after Terminal 2 - to local ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hokuso Railway"]}," services.

During the morning and early afternoon hours, you should use these Tokkyu services over Sky Access trains as they offer a one-seat, cheaper ride. (Taking the Access train will require you to transfer at Aoto, the only connection being a \"Local\" service to Ueno, hence losing any time-savings you made previously on the Access line). After 4PM (5PM on Weekends), Sky Access trains offer a one-seat ride from Narita Airport directly to Nippori and Ueno; the 20 minutes you'll save on the Sky Access train is worth paying the extra ¥210.\n\nReserved-seat services that are cheaper than the ",{"type":"''","value":["Skyliner"]}," include the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Morning Liner"]}," which operates from the airport to Ueno twice in the morning, and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Evening Liner"]}," which operates from Ueno to the airport six times at night after the final Skyliner service has run.
