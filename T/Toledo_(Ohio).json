It is one of the most productive Ports on the Great Lakes\/St. Lawrence Seaway, and is a designated Foreign Trade Zone area.  The Port of Toledo handles coal, ore, general cargo, and ship repairs, as well as having storage for over 22 million bushels of grain for export. The diverse architecture of Toledo rivals larger cities like Chicago.  It is also home to Libbey Glass, the founders of which had a tremendously positive influence on the amenities of the City.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nPeople had big dreams for Toledo. The location of the city was set on some of the most inhospitable land in the Midwest:  the Great Black Swamp. Early white settlers spent years digging drainage ditches through the swamp, and lining them with clay tiles--when they were not catching mosquito-borne diseases. Michigan and Ohio briefly went to war (no one was killed) over the land. By an act of Congress, Ohio was awarded Toledo, while Michigan received the Upper Peninsula. Later settlers came over from Eastern Europe, or up from down south, to work on the Erie Canal, and still later to work in local factories that made early automobiles and auto parts. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Toledo OH COSI park.pg.jpg"],["thumb"],["Promenade Park"]]},"\n\nToday, Toledo is a city of 315,000 with a big local university, an independent daily newspaper, and historic buildings downtown, some of which have been turned into artists' lofts. The cityscape today provides some good opportunities for photographs of derelict buildings. Toledo is also home to the legendary Toledo Mud Hens minor league baseball team. They play in the Fifth Third Field in downtown Toledo. Near downtown, the Old West End is a beautiful neighborhood of Victorian mansions, and is where the world-class Toledo Museum of Art and its new glass museum can be found. A world-class Toledo Zoo is a few miles to the south. In the north end, there is the Polish Village where it is common to see storefronts written in Polish. The food in Toledo is worth stopping for. As well as the many diners in the area, many ethnic eateries should not be missed, including Tony Packo's famous Hungarian hot dogs, Hungarian baked goods, classy Middle Eastern places such as the Beirut, and delicious Indian cuisine from the Tandoor.  True or not, Toledo likes to think that it has the most restaurants per capita in the entire country.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["Toledo"],["41.65"],["-83.59"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The nearest airport is: ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.toledoexpress.com Toledo Express Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TOL"]]},"), 11013 Airport Highway, +1 419 865-2351."]},{"type":"*","value":["The nearest regional\/international airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport"],["Detroit Metro Airport"]]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["DTW"]]},")."]},"\nAirport Shuttle Services available from Toledo to Detroit Metro Airport by reservation.
