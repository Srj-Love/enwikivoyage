The history of Toledo dates back to Roman occupation (Toletum) circa 192BC.  The ruins of the Roman circus are still visible just outside the walls of the city.  Roman occupation was followed by Visigoth rule, Muslim rule and finally the Reconquest of Toledo in 1085AD.  Toledo was the capital of the Spanish empire until the mid 1500's when the royal court moved to Madrid.  The winding, cobbled streets of the old town are often crowded with locals and tourists, as well as a surprisingly large number of cars and vans. Don't miss the 13th century cathedral or the Alcázar which sits atop the town and dates back to Roman times. \n\nDenoted a UNESCO heritage site in 1986, Toledo represents a very worthwhile day-trip from Madrid.

There is often spot congestion during peak hours, sometimes as far out as Parla (25 km).\n\nParking on the narrow cobbled streets of inner Toledo is virtually impossible except for short loading\/unloading stops, but there's a big garage in Calle de Santa Úrsula, right in the centre.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBuses run between Toledo and Madrid's Plaza Elíptica bus station (on the grey Circular metro line) every half hour until 21:30. The company is Alsa (old Continental-Auto). The trip takes about one hour and a return ticket costs €8.96. From the Toledo bus terminal it is a steep but picturesque 20 minute walk up to the old town. A local bus service is also available.  To catch a local bus from the Toledo bus station to the center of town, head out of the station for a bit and you will see a bus stand, catch a bus going to Plaza Zocodover.

Be sure to arrive on time, at least 1 hour before scheduled departure time in Atocha. Boarding starts 30 minutes prior to departure and the gate will close 5 minutes before schedule. Procedures are less strict upon returning from Toledo however keeping a 30 minute margin here is recommended.\n\nIn Madrid they have installed many vending machines.
