Compared to neighbouring ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Rai Leh"]]}]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Ao Nang"]]}]}," it's relatively rough around on the edges; in particular, the beach gets unsuitable for swimming and becomes quite rocky as the tide goes out. But this only happens for about ten days every moon period. The rest of the time the beach is suitable for swimming.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nThere's no easy overland access to Ton Sai, so all visitors arrive by boat. There are however a difficult trek that will take 1.5 hours from Ao Nang, but its not recommended when you are carrying luggage, and people using this route are regularly attacked by gangs of wild monkeys. There is a half-hour trail from East Rai Leh, also not recommended when carrying luggage, and without gangs of wild monkeys to worry about. At low tide, there is a somewhat difficult scramble between the north end of West Rail Leh Beach through to Ton Sai's easternmost stretch of beach. Rai Leh is a five minute longtail ride, necessary at high tide, while longtails from Ao Nang to Rai Leh will also stop at Ton Sai. Boats between Ton Sai and Rai Leh generally don't run at night.\n\nIf you're arriving from Krabi bus station you will need to get a taxi or tuk-tuk to Ao Nang Beach. The price should be around 60 baht. Expect the tuk-tuk to drive around a bit and pick up more people if its not full. From there, share or charter a boat to Ton Sai. Boats run frequently from Ao Nang Beach to Ton Sai. But only when enough people have gathered and the boat is full with 10-12 persons. In high season it takes around 20 minutes to fill a boat depending on the time of the day. In low season it usually takes longer. Tickets cost 100 baht at the ticket-stand at the south end of Ao Nang Beach. The price almost doubles after 18:00.\n\nAlternatively, chart a boat and make a deal with the boatman. Expect to pay the price of 10 tickets if you want the boat all by yourself.\n\nThe boat ride from Ao Nang Beach to Ton Sai takes 8â€“10 minutes and is very scenic.\n\nThere are three ways to reach Rai Leh on foot:\n\n1) At low tide you can walk around the rocky outcrop which separates Ton Sai from Rai Leh (20 min).\n\n2) At high tide, go to the south end of Ton Sai Beach, walk the obvious path at the end of the beach, through the forest, up and over the rocky outcrop. You'll pop out on the north side of Rai Leh West (20 min).\n\n3) The least-used option is a longer trail through the jungle. Walk away from the Ton Sai Beach along the road where all the bungalows and resorts are. When you get to Wee's Climbing School turn (east) and continue on the road up hill. Eventually you'll pass all the bungalows.  Continue on the path and you will eventually pop out on Rai Leh East near the Diamond Cave area (50 min). Although longer, this trail is smoother and easier to walk than the shorter one.\n\nNone of these options is possible at night without a flashlight\/torch, and the jungle paths can be slippery and treacherous after the rain.\n\nAlternatively hire a kayak and sail around (10 min).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\nThe only way to get around Ton Sai is on foot.
