It became a constitutional monarchy in 1875 and a British protectorate in 1900. Tonga acquired its independence in 1970 and became a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. It is one of the few indigenous monarchies in the Pacific.  Tonga is one of the last absolute monarchies in the world and is based upon an essentially feudal system where the king disburses land and positions without recourse to any elected body. Although Tongan royalty is largely loved and revered by Tongans, younger people have an appetite for stronger accountability and a more modern constitution. An election was held in November 2010. This was planned to lead to a major reduction in the powers of the King and the land-owning nobility in favour of a more democratic form of governance. However, of the 26 seats in Parliament only 17 are elected, with the rest being allocated to the nobles. After some horse trading, it was a noble who emerged as the Prime Minister.\n\nTonga has an economy with none of the corporate chain stores and with local small businesses providing all necessary goods and services. Tourists were not a target during the riots and you will find Tonga a friendly and appealing place to visit although don't expect the same level of infrastructure as in more developed countries.\n\nThere were pro-democracy riots in Nuku'alofa in November 2006 which left 8 people dead and large portions of the town centre burnt out.  Rebuilding after the riots in Nuku'alofa has been more or less completed and there are abundant tourism facilities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n\nThe country is divided into four island groups, or regions.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["regionlist"],["regionmap=Tonga regions map.png"],["regionmaptext="],["regionmapsize=180px"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tongatapu"]]}],["region1color=#eaf59e"],["region1items="],["region1description=home of the capital, Nuku'alofa."],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["'Eua"]]}],["region2color=#ddbe89"],["region2items="],["region2description=an unspoilt island just southeast of Tongatapu"],["region3name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vava'u"]]}],["region3color=#a7cbcb"],["region3items="],["region3description=a popular yachting destination."],["region4name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ha'apai"]]}],["region4color=#9bc7d3"],["region4items="],["region4description=the least populated group."],["region5name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Niuas"]]}],["region5color=#cdc5d7"],["region5items="],["region5description=remote islands to the north of Tonga: Niuafo'ou, Niuatoputapu, and Tafahi are collectively known as the \"Niuas.\""]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Visas "]},"\nCitizens of the following countries can get a free, one-month visitor's visa on arrival if they can prove they have a return ticket to leave Tonga at the end of their stay and sufficient funds to cover their stay:\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austria"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bahamas"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barbados"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belgium"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brazil"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brunei"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bulgaria"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cook Islands"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cyprus"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Czech Republic"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denmark"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dominica"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Estonia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fiji"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French Polynesia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hungary"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ireland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italy"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kiribati"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Korea"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Latvia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lithuania"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Luxembourg"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malaysia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malta"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marshall Islands"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Federated States of Micronesia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Monaco"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nauru"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netherlands"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Caledonia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Niue"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norway"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Palau"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Papua New Guinea"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Poland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portugal"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Romania"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samoa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seychelles"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Solomon Islands"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Slovakia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Slovenia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Kitts and Nevis"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Lucia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Switzerland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkey"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tuvalu"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ukraine"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vanuatu"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wallis and Futuna"]]},".\n\nVisitor's visas can be extended at the immigration department in the capital.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Fua'amotu Airport (TBU)"]}," is on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tongatapu"]]}," around half an hour from Nuku'alofa.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Air New Zealand flies from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Auckland"]]}," five times weekly, and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samoa"]]}," once weekly.

Formerly served by Chathams Pacific Airline, services in Tonga have been suspended from 3 March 2013. This is because the Government is to open a competing airline with a plane provided free of charge by the Chinese Government. There is a hiatus between the closing of Chathams and the opening of the new airline, making communication between the islands very difficult.\n\nMotorbikes, scooters and cycles can be rented on Tongatapu, Vava'u and Ha'apai. On Tongatapu you can hire a car. There are also taxis. To get around the main island, Tongatapu, Teta Tours and Toni's guest house offer day tours of all the main tourist sights.  The speed limit is usually 40kph and this is stuck to by the local drivers. You're meant to also buy a local Tongan driving licence on top of your existing licence before you drive (25 Pa'anga). The roads are good in and around Nuku'alofa but deteriorate the further from the town and the further south you travel.Most cars in Tonga are in a terrible state, maintained on a budget and held together by a combination of 'Western Union' stickers and prayer.

There are some interesting places to visit, such as ancient tombs and coastal blowholes, and some nice beaches with good snorkelling.

The waters of the islands are known for their clarity.  The area attracts many humpback whales between June and November and there are organised tours to see them. Other things to do include diving, renting a yacht, kayaking; game fishing and kite surfing. There are some good walks on the main island. There are many places to stay both in the capital Neiafu and on the outlying islands.

Diving, snorkelling, fishing, boat trips, kayaking and kite surfing are all possible. There are some lovely beaches if you just want to laze around. Tonga has some good restaurants and this is the place to come if you like lobster.\n\nTake time to learn a little about Tonga's fairly feudal culture and its many traditions. Go to church. Even if you are not religious the singing can be very moving. Watch tapa cloth being made from mulberry bark and try a drink of kava, the traditional drink, which is a mild narcotic.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe national currency is the Pa'anga, or Tongan dollar. Denominations are 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 seniti coins and 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 Pa'anga banknotes. Although Tonga is a developing country, prices for many things are comparable to or slightly greater than New Zealand or Australia. Most of what you eat, apart from fish, lobsters, roots and tubers, fruits and vegetables will have been imported. A good meal out will cost 30-50 Pa'anga, a beer in a restaurant or bar costs about 5-6 Pa'anga, hiring a car is about 50-60 Pa'anga a day and cigarettes are 7-8 Pa'anga for a pack of 25.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Tapa.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Tongan tapa"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tapa."]}," Tapa cloth is made from the bulk of the paper mulberry tree. Although tapa is found throughout Polynesia, Tonga is the only country where it is still a part of daily life. The bark is stripped from the tree trunk and the outer bark is then scraped off from the inner bark and discarded. The inner bark is first dried in the sun before being soaked. It is then beaten into strips of 25cm using wooden mallets. The continuous beats of the tapa mallet are still a common sound in Tongan villages. The narrow strips are then beaten together into a wider sheet and decorated."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nTongan feasts are a must-do.

Or you can buy the same bottles from one of the many 'Chinese' roadside shops or a supermarket for 2 Pa'anga or less. Imported beers are mainly from Australia although there are also some from Europe.

Tongans don't want to hear that it's hard on the coral beaches lined with palm trees and emerald lagoons.  There are many opportunities for skilled trades from the streets to the shops, in the schools to the churches and yes from the markets to the office.  This is a hot spot for skilled navigators spanning throughout 169 villages and 150 islands.  Some major exports include Vanilla, handcrafts and specialty pumpkins grown for export to Japan.  Other agriculture sectors include root crops like taro, tapioca, sweet potatoes, yams, coconuts, bananas, mangoes, papayas, pineapples, watermelons and even peanuts.\n\nIf you are on a visitor's visa, you cannot be involved with business or take up employment while in Tonga. You also cannot take courses from an educational institution. It is mostly illegal to try to change a visitor's visa into a visa that allows for employment, so if you intend to have a job while in Tonga, make sure you have an employment visa in advance. Apply for your visa at least one month in advance. If you are already in Tonga and would like to extend it, contact the immigration department one month in advance about the extension.\n\nWhile employment visas are technically available, the immigration department will probably be reluctant to granted you one as Tonga has a high unemployment rate, and would prefer that jobs be taken up by Tongan citizens as opposed to outsiders.

Keep in mind that Sunday is strongly revered, the vast majority of the population will attend religious services, very few shops will be open and there is very little to do. \nHotels will be open, as will some restaurant and beach resorts, although mainly to serve expats and tourists. Small shops, including, in Nuku'alofa, a popular bakery, may open later on Sunday afternoon. \n\nTV stations close or play Christian shows on Sundays. Radio stations will also play religious on Sundays. To compensate, the cinema in Nuku'alofa usually has a screening just after midnight on Monday morning.\n\nTonga features many major Christian denominations; the Methodist church especially has a widespread presence.
