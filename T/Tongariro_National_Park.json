Take good clothing even on sunny days. Cases of hypothermia are relatively common due to poorly equipped people attempting the walk.\n\nThe walk is usually done from the Mangatepopo Road end to the Ketetahi Road, as the Ketetahi end is at a lower elevation. The walk is crowded in summer, with up to 2000 people a day. The only water en route is at two huts; one at the start of the track and the other at the end.\n\nA side trip to the summit and crater of Ngauruhoe adds two hours of mostly hard, steep climbing, and provides excellent views on a good day. You can run down the scree slopes on the way back, but the scree is sharp and may cut if you hit it with bare skin. \n\nA short and easy side trip (one hour return from Red Crater) can be made to the much less spectacular summit of Tongariro. Red Crater can be entered from near the Emerald Lakes by walking up the steaming slope south of the lakes. Frodo and Sam walked up this slope during their vacation in Mordor. Blue Lake is sacred to Maori and is tapu, so treat it with respect. A short scramble off-track to the left leads to North Crater. A sidle around the massif to the right from near Ketetahi takes you to the Te Maari craters.\n\nThe crossing can be done in winter, but alpine skills, ice axe and crampons are essential. In winter, a high standard of navigational skill may be required as the poles marking the track may be buried in snow and mist may reduce visibility to 10m or less.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Tongariro Northern Circuit"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.doc.govt.nz\/parks-and-recreation\/tracks-and-walks\/central-north-island\/turangi-taupo\/tongariro-northern-circuit\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A 51.5km hike, taking 3 or 4 days.
