[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Australia-oceania default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.toodyay.com\/ ",{"type":"'''","value":["Toodyay"]}]}," is a small rural town of about 1,000 people located 85 km east of Perth in the Avon valley. The town was founded in 1836 and its shire (also named Toodyay) is part of the Wheatbelt region, and the Avon region of Western Australia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nToodyay is one of three towns east of the Darling Scarp which were established very early in the development of Western Australia.  Toodyay, Northam and York are all on the Avon river, the upper portion of the same river that flows through metropolitan Perth - the Swan river.  Each town is the location of 'old' pioneering families who were (and some cases still are) landholders, and early farmers of the region.  All three towns thrived in the era of small scale agriculture, however with many changes in agricultural methods, and agriculture in general, the towns have suffered.  Each town has adjusted accordingly.  Because of its location on the current railway line to Perth, there are people who commute by train from Toodyay to Perth, despite its distance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe usual way of getting in is by train or car. \n\nThe more adventurous can arrive by horse or bicycle, but these require access to the bicycle or horse in the first place.  To ride by bike from Perth is an adventure for the fit, as the hills are long and steep, and the passing cars are not usually prepared to see bicycles on their narrow race track.\n\nA train can be taken from Perth to Toodyay and there are three choices of services: AvonLink, MerredinLink and Prospector.\n\nTravelling by car is probably the easiest way, as Toodyay can be only an hour's drive from the Perth metropolitan area. The most direct route to Toodyay from Perth would be along Toodyay Road.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIt's easy enough to walk around town if you wish to see most of the sights, parks, cafes, restaurants, pubs and accommodation. However, it is advisable that you have a car if you wish to visit any of the farms around Toodyay.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nToodyay was one of WA's earliest settlements.  Sight-seeing can involve visiting some of the town's old (heritage-listed) buildings, the range of other places can be in the surrounding countryside as well.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Connor's Mill"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.toodyay.com\/accom_result1\/connors-mill\/"],["email="],["address=7 Piesse Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +61 8  9574 2435"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Mon-Sun: 09:00-16:00"],["price="],["content=  The museum educates visitors about Toodyay's agricultural history and the history of the mill.
