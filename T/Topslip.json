The more adventurous can go on forest treks hoping to spot anything from the Indian Bison, several varieties of deer, wild boar, wild elephants, Asiatic wild dogs, sloth bear and the elusive tiger. Most animals are nocturnal visitors and therefore a night ride arranged by the forest department is highly recommended. There is an elephant training camp which is worth a visit.\nMany tourists recommend the elephant safari as it meanders through the forest: lookout for the nilgiri langurs! Though wildcat sighting is rare. However, there is plenty of fauna. Topslip is an ornithologists delight: there are nearly 250 species of birds in the Karian Shola area, but be warned, the dreaded King Cobra is never far off!\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Trekking"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Van Safari"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Elephant Safari"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Forest Canteen provides very spartan food.
