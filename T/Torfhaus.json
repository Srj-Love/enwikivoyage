The river flows northwards through the Radau valley that it has carved out and feeds the 23 m high Radau Waterfall south of Bad Harzburg immediately next to the B 4 federal road. The artificial waterfall was constructed as a tourist attraction in 1859 on behalf of the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway, which had operated the Brunswickâ€“Bad Harzburg railway line since 1841. After passing through Vienenburg, the Radau discharges into the Oker river northeast of the town.\n\nIn the Middle Ages the Radau was used for the rafting of logs and wooden palettes stacked with peat. To that end the river was dammed by 6 raft locks. The goods to be rafted, that had previously been dropped in the river, were transported downstream with the additional weight of water.\n\nAt the Radau Waterfall is a restaurant and a children's railway integrated into the landscape.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Bavaria Alm"],["url=http:\/\/www.bavariaalm.de\/index.php?id=46"],["email="],["address=Torfhaus 38"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=on the B4 federal road at Torfhaus"],["phone = +49 5320 331034"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=9am-12pm daily"],["price=Mid-price range"],["content=A Bavarian-style restaurant in the middle of the Harz.
