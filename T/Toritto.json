Another notable place is the Pulicchio, a huge cave with no ceiling which has produced an incredibly rich eco-system.\nTotitto is famous for its enchanting masserie \"a pignon\", a stone farmhouse, built with the same technique as trulli.

The \"a pignon\" style makes the masserie in Toritto to have a very archaic look.
