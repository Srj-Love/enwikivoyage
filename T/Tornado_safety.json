They generate high winds (often 100-200 miles\/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.  They begin as funnels descending from storm clouds, and become \"tornadoes\" when they touch the ground.  Unlike hurricanes, tornadoes develop very quickly, giving little advance warning that one is coming (minutes at most), but they are also very short-lived, likewise lasting only a matter of minutes each.  They frequently occur in clusters, with several tornadoes striking an area around the same time.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Tornado_activity.png"],["right"],["thumb"],["300px"],["U.S. areas reporting the strongest classes of tornado"]]},"\n\nThere are about 1,000 tornadoes reported each year in the US, but only a small percentage of those touch down and strike buildings. Also, less than 30% of the tornadoes that occur are significantly powerful (EF2+). Most deaths occur to occupants of mobile homes and cars.  Tornadoes can occur any time during the year, but they are most frequent in the spring and early summer, in thunderstorm weather.  Keep in mind that as a short-term visitor, the odds of you being in the wrong place at the wrong time to face a tornado are quite small, regardless of when and where you travel.  But it's good to be prepared.\n\nAn area where tornadoes occur frequently is dubbed ",{"type":"'''","value":["\"Tornado Alley\""]},".

If you hear what sounds like an air raid siren, this is probably a tornado siren sounding, and you should seek shelter immediately.  Note that many communities periodically test these systems at a set time, such as at exactly 12:00 noon on a weekday of the first week of each month, so check the time and the skies (tornadoes do not develop in sunny weather) before panicking.  (Most communities will skip these tests if the weather is stormy, to avoid causing undue alarm.)\n\nHeavy rain and hail can hide a tornado from view.  This is especially likely in the more humid regions of the southern and eastern US.  Tornadoes will also be very difficult to see at nighttime, unless backlit by frequent lightning.

Stay calm and find the safest area you can get to quickly.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["House"]},"\n\nIf you are in a house, get away from the windows (which will probably shatter) and go to the lowest floor. If there is a basement, go there and get under something such as a bench or table. If there is no basement, go to a center room with no windows, such as a closet or bathroom. If in the bathroom, lie down in the tub. Crouch down and if you have some padding such as a mattress to protect you from flying or falling debris, put that over you.  Do not waste time that can be better spent getting to shelter by trying to open windows to prevent them from breaking.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Tall building"]},"\n\nGo to the lowest floor or center of the building away from windows and close to an interior wall. Crouch down and cover your head. Do not get in the elevator; you'll be trapped if the electricity goes out, and there's always a chance that the lift mechanism will give out if the roof is damaged.  If you're not too high, use internal stairways to reach the ground floor or basement.  Stairwells are probably one of the safer places to seek shelter in such circumstances anyway (i.e. no windows, sturdy construction).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Get out!"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:FEMA - 3733 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 05-04-1999 in Oklahoma.jpg"],["right"],["300px"]]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"''","value":["least"]}," safe place to be is inside something the tornado can pick up; you're actually better off ",{"type":"''","value":["outside"]},".\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Mobile home"]},"\n\nIf you are in a mobile home and there's a tornado warning, you should seek out the nearest storm shelter or protected building.

Your safest option is to leave the car and get in a sturdy building. If that is not available, get out of the car and get in a low area such as a culvert, drain pipe or ditch. If you are staying in your car, attempt to drive at right angles to the tornado to get out of its path.  If the tornado does not appear to be moving left or right, chances are it is coming straight for you.  A car is probably safer than a mobile home (less wind-catching surface to drag it into the air), but it's still safer to get out and hunker down low.  The best option is to find a ditch to lie flat in, and cover up.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["After a tornado"]},"\nWatch out for sharp objects and downed power lines. Do not stand in water where there are power lines down. Stay out of heavily damaged houses and buildings as there may be a danger of collapse.
