The city is laid out on a very straightforward grid pattern and streets rarely deviate from the grid, except in cases where topography interferes such as the indented, curved Don River Valley and to a lesser degree the Humber and Rouge valleys at opposite ends of the city.

This is also known as Metropolitan Toronto or \"the 416\" after its area code (although now there are some new area codes, the overwhelming number of landline phone numbers in the Toronto area are still \"416\") and has a population of over 2.6 million people. More than half of these were born in some country other than Canada: a fact obvious to any visitor immediately, as the city has many vibrant bustling neighbourhoods with street signs in several languages.\n\nToronto and its surrounding suburbs are collectively known as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greater Toronto Area"]]}," (GTA). Outlying suburbs are also known as \"the 905\" after ",{"type":"''","value":["their"]}," area code, although technically this code is also used in both ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hamilton (Ontario)"],["Hamilton"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Niagara Region"]]},", stretching from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cobourg"]]}," and Colborne in the east to the border in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Niagara Falls (Ontario)"],["Niagara Falls"]]}," to the southwest. The entire area including Toronto is known as the \"Golden Horseshoe\" and has a population of over 8 million people. Distances between cities in the area can be great as it sprawls along, outward and even wraps around the western end of Lake Ontario; public transit is not always effective enough to make it a quick or seamless trip. Many suburban residents rely on motor vehicles to get around.\n\nA popular urban myth has it that the United Nations rated Toronto as \"the most multicultural city in the world\". While the UN and its agencies are not in the habit of rating cities, it remains a fact that Canada is a nation of immigrants, and Toronto demonstrates this abundantly. A UN agency lists Toronto as second only to Miami as the city with the most foreign-born residents, but Toronto's residents represent far more cultural and language groups, which is arguably a better measure of multi-culturalism. Most immigrants either pass through Toronto on their way to other parts of the country or stay in Toronto permanently. Many people born abroad consider themselves Canadian as much as born Canadians and will be offended if treated otherwise. This contributes to the overall cultural mosaic that is Toronto today. Within Toronto, most ethnic groups will work their way into the fabric of Canadian society but some still retain their distinct ways such as language, dress (if only for special occasions), customs, and food.\n\nAs a result of this cultural mosaic, Toronto is home to many ethnic festivals throughout the year. Toronto also boasts several radio stations which broadcast in various languages as well as at least two multicultural television channels. The City of Toronto officially deals in 16 different languages while the Toronto Transit Commission (public transit) has a helpline that deals in 70 languages. Even large department stores such as The Bay in downtown Toronto proudly advertise service in 9 languages. The lingua franca of Toronto, however, remains English.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   -1"],["febhigh =   0"],["marhigh =   5"],["aprhigh =   12"],["mayhigh =   18"],["junhigh =   24"],["julhigh =   27"],["aughigh =   26"],["sephigh =   21"],["octhigh =   14"],["novhigh =   8"],["dechigh =   2"],["janlow =   -7"],["feblow =   -6"],["marlow =   -2"],["aprlow =   4"],["maylow =   10"],["junlow =   15"],["jullow =   18"],["auglow =   18"],["seplow =   14"],["octlow =   7"],["novlow =   2"],["declow =   -3"],["janprecip =   61"],["febprecip =   51"],["marprecip =   66"],["aprprecip =   70"],["mayprecip =   73"],["junprecip =   72"],["julprecip =   68"],["augprecip =   80"],["sepprecip =   83"],["octprecip =   65"],["novprecip =   76"],["decprecip =   71"],["janh2o ="],["febh2o ="],["marh2o ="],["aprh2o ="],["mayh2o ="],["junh2o ="],["julh2o ="],["augh2o ="],["seph2o ="],["octh2o ="],["novh2o ="],["dech2o ="],["description = See the Toronto 7 day forecast at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.weatheroffice.gc.ca\/city\/pages\/on-143_metric_e.html Environment Canada"]}]]},"\n\nToronto's climate is on the whole on the cool side and variable conditions can be expected, temperatures average -3.8°C (25°F) in January downtown, however the type of extreme cold experienced in parts of Canada further north do not hold a tight grip for usually more than a couple of days at a time, despite this come prepared, winters are still cold, mostly cloudy and at times, snowy and uncomfortably windy.

Be advised that traffic on incoming highways can be extremely heavy.  In the downtown core there are many turn restrictions, particularly from main thoroughfares to other main thoroughfares (e.g. Yonge to Dundas Streets).\n\nThe main streets in Toronto are laid out in a grid pattern that makes it one of the easiest cities to get around in by car.  Getting from point to point anywhere in the city can be achieved with only a few turns.

Often (especially during rush hour when large crowds are to be expected), passengers will step out into the road before the streetcar has come to a complete stop, in anticipation of the doors opening. In this situation, it is customary to stop, as crowds of passengers can overwhelm the road within seconds, and some can be quite brazen about stepping off the curb. If a streetcar pulls alongside your vehicle while you are stopped, and opens its doors, you must remain stationary until the doors have closed. Cyclists on the road frequently disregard the stopping rule, as they generally can fit around the crowd, but it is best practice to stop, out of consideration for passengers.\n\n::*However, if a traffic island (it'll look like a raised median with a transit shelter on top) separates the streetcar from your lane, you may pass with caution. Beware of jaywalkers who do not wait until the light has changed to cross the lane.\n\n:*When in mixed traffic, streetcar tracks are located in the centre lane of the road. Streetcars perform right turns from this lane; other vehicles are generally not permitted to do so (except oversized trucks), and it is important to give clearance so that turns can be made, whether travelling in the same direction as the streetcar or facing an oncoming one.

Buses and streetcars are prone to get caught in Toronto's notorious traffic during rush-hours, though some streetcar lines have dedicated lanes.\n\nToronto's long streetcar lines have resulted in chronic \"bunching\", where one might wait for thirty minutes at a stop, and then 4 streetcars will arrive bunched together. In contrast to this, the subway system is quite fast and efficient; the subway lines extend well into the suburbs and have spurred a great deal of high-density, high-rise development in far-flung neighbourhoods that would not otherwise have had any large-scale development. A prime example of this is the neighbourhood of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toronto\/North York"],["North York"]]},", filled with high-rise development right on top of three subway stations.

When using the subway, all manned booths sell tokens and there may be vending machines at unmanned entrances. Be aware that some token vending machines are out of service, but do not have signs on them to indicate that, otherwise making it safer to use manned ticket booths whenever possible.\n\nA day pass is available for $10.75.

In this case, you can enter the station by presenting a valid transfer. If you don't have one, you need to pay another cash fare.\n\nTransfers are free, but should be obtained at the first vehicle or station you enter on your journey. If your journey starts on a bus or streetcar, ask for one as you pay your fare (simply saying \"Transfer, please\" to the operator will suffice). If you start at a subway station, look for a red machine just beyond the ticket booth with a digital time clock on its face. Press the gold button and collect your transfer.\n\nA transfer may also be used to pass from a bus or streetcar to another bus or streetcar moving in a perpendicular direction - for example, from a northbound bus to an eastbound streetcar. But in doing so, make sure to transfer at the first intersection possible (i.e. do not get out at an intersection, walk east for a block, and transfer there).\n\nUnlike other transit systems, a transfer is valid for one trip rather than a specific duration of time (i.e. you cannot use a transfer obtained going on a northbound bus to go on a bus of the same route southbound).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Connecting public transit services "]},"\n\nThe areas that surround Toronto—",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mississauga"]]},", Brampton, York Region, Durham Region—have their own transit systems.

Although fares and transfer rules are set individually by each transit operator, using the card generally provides a discount from the cash fare and discounted or free transfers between certain systems.

The majority of these services, especially trains, are oriented to weekday commuters travelling to and from downtown Toronto. Trains are large and comfortable, but with the exception of the half-hourly Burlington–Toronto–Oshawa Lakeshore line, they run only at peak times. The GO bus network is much more extensive and fills in for trains in the off-peak hours. The vast majority of tourist destinations are reachable by TTC, although you might want to use the GO network to get to the Zoo, or to the homes of family members or friends in the Greater Toronto Area.\n\nGO fares are the same on buses and trains, and are distance-based. The suburban bus services (but not the TTC) sometimes offer discounts on connections to or from a GO Transit rail station. The GTA Pass is not valid on GO Transit.\n\nNOTE: in many cases, a GO bus will not stop unless the passengers-to-be indicate wanting to be picked up, even if they are standing at a designated stop. Users must flag the bus down, usually just by raising their hand or ticket in the air as the bus approaches. That is because GO stops often share stops with other municipal transit systems.\n\nGO Trains operate on the Proof-of-Payment system; passengers must possess a valid ticket for the entire length of their journey before boarding a train. Tickets cannot be purchased on board, and there are no gates or staff before boarding to ensure you have a fare for a particular train. GO Transit enforcement officers conduct random inspections of tickets, issuing expensive fines to anyone without the correct fare. Enforcement officers have likely heard every possible excuse from passengers who regularly try to avoid paying a fare, and are often unforgiving of any (even legitimate) reason you might give.\n\nEach GO train runs with a three-person crew. There are two engineers, who are responsible for operations, as well as the Customer Service Ambassador, who is responsible for passenger service (opening\/closing doors, making station announcements, answering questions, dealing with emergencies, etc.) The CSA is stationed in the Accessibility car (the 5th car behind the locomotive), and introduces him\/herself during his\/her opening spiel.

However, travelling longer distances, when not close to subway lines is often significantly faster by car or taxi.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By bicycle "]},"\n\nToronto is trying very hard to become a bike-friendly city, with dedicated bike lanes being added all the time.

Generally speaking, if you are on the road, you are expected to obey the same laws as cars, and you are not allowed to ride on the sidewalk. In reality, cyclists have all sorts of driving styles; expect the unexpected.\n\nThe city is predominantly flat, aside from a general climb away from Lake Ontario and the deeply indented, forested Don Valley and Humber River Valley, and post-and-ring locking posts are present throughout the city.

Local calls are not metered, so you can talk as long as you want. Due to the popularity of cellphones, there are fewer pay phone booths than in previous years, so they can be difficult to locate. Most large public facilities still have ample pay phones to use. In malls, pay phones are usually located between the inner and outer doors at the entrances. Payphones are also routinely available in subway stations, often on the platforms. Cellular service is generally unavailable in the subway, except in outdoor areas or rare parts in shallow tunnels. In other underground areas, such as the lower levels of malls and in the PATH, reception is generally available, if somewhat weaker.\n\nIn addition, many public facilities (such as shopping malls) now also have phones which provide free local calls, which are funded by advertisements run on colour LCD screens. Watch for large, wall-mounted ovals in high-traffic areas.\n\nToronto has three area codes: 416, 647, and 437. These area codes are all associated with the same geographic area. The suburban areas outside of the city have three overlapping area codes: 905, 289, and 365. As a result, Toronto has ",{"type":"'''","value":["10-digit local dialing"]},".

It's not hard to find a place to call home and the costs are normally around $3 for 30 minutes. The widespread availability of high-speed internet access means that internet cafes are largely becoming a thing of the past, so on repeat visits to the city, you may find that the one you used last time has disappeared. Most major hotels offer high-speed internet in their rooms and in their business centres. Most coffee shops, and many food courts and restaurants in the city offer wireless internet (more often free, sometimes not).\n\nCogeco operates a public WiFi network called ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.onezone.ca One Zone"]}]}," that covers six square kilometres in the downtown core.

You'll also find newspapers in Spanish, Portuguese, Persian, Arabic, Tagalog, Greek, Urdu and more.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Crime"]},"\n\nToronto is remarkably safe and the streets are vibrant with pedestrians and bicyclists, even at night in most neighbourhoods.  If you use common sense, you should have no trouble at all.\n\nThe overall violent crime rate in Canada, and particularly in Toronto, is much lower than that found in major cities in the United States. Petty crime is generally not a problem in Toronto, but as always is the case, keep vigilant with your possessions. Car and bike theft are comparable to other large North American cities.\n\nThere are neighbourhoods which are known in the media and on the street as being more dangerous, though police statistics are not commonly used to justify these beliefs. Nevertheless, while assaults and other crimes can happen anywhere, especially late at night when few people are around, it is reasonable to avoid certain areas (again, generally late at night). These areas include in the old city and inner bouroughs: Crescent Town, Regent Park, parts of Parkdale, parts of St. Jamestown, Moss Park, Alexandra Park, Flemingdon Park\/Victoria Village and Weston-Mount Dennis. Outer areas: Jane and Finch (\"Jane Corridor\"), Lawrence Heights, the Peanut (i.e. Don Mills and Sheppard), Rexdale\/Jamestown Crescent, Malvern, Kingston and Galloway, Steeles-L’Amoureaux, Dorset Park, Westminster-Branson and Eglinton East-Kennedy Park. Stay away from dodgy looking areas, where drugs, prostitution and violent crime such as armed robberies can occur. These neighbourhoods become noticeably worse from a visual standpoint, giving ample warning to turn around.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Homeless"]},"\nToronto has a visible homeless population, many of whom will ask you for money. If you do not want to offer them money, simply look the beggar in the eye and say \"No thank you\" or ignore them. If you do give the person money, they usually leave you alone. There have been occasional occurrences of aggressive beggars, with one resulting in a fatality. If a beggar becomes aggressive, move away quickly and alert a police officer.\n\nBeggars in Toronto have been known to ask for handouts on the pretext that they need TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) fare. When offered TTC tokens, they will accept them and then approach other passers-by in an attempt to resell these tokens for cash. If a street person offers to sell you a token they claim to have \"found\" in Toronto, sometimes at less than face value, odds are this fare media was given to them by some well-meaning passer-by who believed their false claim that they needed TTC fare to get home.\n\nThere have also been instances in the past with \"squeegee kids\" who would jump into intersections when traffic is stopped at lights and solicit money for cleaning windshields. This is becoming less common as this form of interference with vehicle traffic is expressly illegal under Ontario's Highway Traffic Act and may be reported to police.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Pedestrians"]},"\n\nBe careful when getting off the streetcars and look always to your right before leaving the car. Although vehicles are supposed to stop when the streetcar doors open, some motorists and cyclists will ignore this and keep going.\n\nThe proliferation of mobile data devices has led to \"multitasking\" in a large percentage of the pedestrian population of this city. If driving, cycling, or even walking, in Toronto do not forget to keep an eye open for a pedestrian who may be a little more focused on his or her device than is healthy.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Weather"]},"\n\nAvoid river\/creek banks or bridge underpasses during periods of excessive rain, during\/after heavy thundershowers or melting snow. Recent flooding can soften soil and cause it to suddenly collapse into the water under any weight.\n\nOccasionally, Toronto will be hit with a severe winter storm accompanied by significant snowfall (quite often mixed with freezing rain\/ice\/sleet). Avoid driving during and immediately after the storms if at all possible. This is especially true for those unfamiliar with winter driving and controlling a car in a skid. Take public transit, walk, or stay inside.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consulates"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Bangladesh"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Bangladesh"],["url=http:\/\/www.sacgtoronto.com"],["email="],["address=55 Avenue Rd, East Tower Suite 2250"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 416 964-4408"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 416 964-4333"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Brazil"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Brazil"],["url=http:\/\/www.consbrastoronto.org\/index.php"],["email="],["address=77 Bloor Street West, Suite 1109"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 416 922-2503"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 416 922-1832"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["China"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=China"],["url="],["email="],["address=240 St. George St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 416 964-7260"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["El Salvador"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=El Salvador"],["url="],["email=103504.2104@compuserver.com"],["address=151 Bloor Street West, Suite 320"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 416 975 0812"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 416 975 0283"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Greece"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Greece"],["url=http:\/\/www.grconsulate.com"],["email=toronto.consulate@greekembassy.ca"],["address=365 Bloor Str.
