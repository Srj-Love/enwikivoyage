It still bears a regal centrality in the region and sits at the crossroads to many smaller towns around.  While the town is pleasant and typical of the region, it is the Montgrí Castle, an unfinished 13th century fortress that looms above the town on the hill and provides the main tourist attraction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nMake the hike up to Montgrí Castle.  The hike up will take around 1-2 hours.  The most common route on the town side of the mountain is the faster in terms sheer distance.  The less common route on the back site of the mountain is an easier walk.  It is definitely a workout with a rise from 0 to 300m above sea level in short time and strong athletic shoes or hiking boots are recommended.  It's also recommended to take care on the town side trail as while the path is marked, it is easy to get lost at points and the mountain is very sheer and dangerous in spots.  Also bring plenty of water as there are no facilities along the way.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThere is a special bread made in the town which looks like a series of muffins stuck together.
