If you're desperate to get to Tosu quickly, a limited express train will get you there in about 20 minutes at a cost of ¥1440. There are about 5 or 6 limited express departures each hour. A Japan Rail Pass allows you to take a nonreserved seat on these services at no charge... just hop on the train. Or, you can reserve a seat, also at no charge, if you feel inclined to do so.\n\nOtherwise, you're better off taking a regular service from Hakata which costs ¥540. Rapid trains reach Tosu in 40 minutes; local trains take one hour.
