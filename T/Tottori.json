Locals offered him lodging for the night, but the next morning, Junpei discovered that he was a prisoner at the bottom of a sandpit, which he and an unnamed woman must shovel out every day in order to keep the house and village from being swallowed in the endless, enigmatic movement of the sand.\n\nThe city itself is the industrial center of the prefecture, with several big electronics factories for companies like Sanyo. The fishing industry is also quite lively. There are also two universities, which attract agricultural students and researchers from other parts of Japan and a small number of foreign students. Although the number of foreign residents in Tottori is low, compared to other major cities in Japan, its 250,000 locals are certainly friendly — and thoroughly unlikely to strand you at the bottom of a sand pit.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist information"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourist Information"],["alt=鳥取市観光案内所"],["url=http:\/\/www.torican.jp"],["email="],["address=JR Tottori Station"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+81 857-22-3318"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tottori Sightseeing Association"],["alt=鳥取市観光協会"],["url=http:\/\/www.torican.jp"],["email="],["address=103 Shinmachi"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+81 857-26-0756"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tottori Sand Dunes Information Center"],["alt=鳥取砂丘情報館サンドパルとっとり"],["url=http:\/\/www.torican.jp\/sandpal\/"],["email="],["address=2083-17 Yuyama Hukube"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+81 857-20-2231"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Tottori.png"],["thumb"],["450px"],["Map of Tottori"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["ANA"]}," runs four daily flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]},"'s Haneda Airport (about 75 minutes).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nTottori is on the JR San'in Main Line, which travels along the coast from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyoto"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shimonoseki"]]},".

The youngest brother of the gods, Okuninushi no Mikoto, felt sorry for the crying rabbit, and told him to bathe in fresh water and dry off with cattails.
