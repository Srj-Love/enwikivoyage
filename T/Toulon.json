The summers are relatively hot, with temperatures usually  higher than 30 °C. June is a hot month but a sudden storm may occur every once in a while . July usually features hot temperatures and blue sky. August may be even hotter, but storms may begin to occur especially after the 15th of the month. Autumns are rainy. Storms *will* occur. Winters are dry. Temperatures don't usually drop sharply under 0 °C, but the wind factor causes a loss in Celsius degrees equal to one less degree per 10 km wind speed, thus with a wind blowing at 50 km\/H O°C will feel like minus 5°C.\n\nUnlike many other towns of France, Toulon is ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," crossed by any big rivers, and there are no big rivers in the whole district (French: ",{"type":"''","value":["département du Var"]},").

When the Romans invaded the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Provence"]]}," (Latin: ",{"type":"''","value":["provincia romana"]},"), they settled a military base and renamed the town Telo Martius, where martius recalls Mars, the Roman god of war.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Provence was under the coup of lords, before being integrated into the French Kingdom in 1482. During the XVIIIth Century, Toulon became an important military port for France, were boats and sails were being built. A famous convict prison was built. During the French Revolution, Toulon gave support to the monarchy, but Bonaparte (later known as Napoleon the Ist) took back the town. During World War II, Toulon was invaded on November the 27th, 1942. The seamen scuttled all the boats so that the Nazis couldn't use them. The town was freed by the Allied Forces on August 25, 1944.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe main roads are from east to west (and the opposite).
