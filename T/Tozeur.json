Many long distance buses also run south to Tozeur.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nTaxis are unmetered in Tozeur; you will have to agree on a price before the journey begins. Prices should be around 2 dinar for a short trip (around a kilometer or less), and more accordingly.\n\nAnother option is in horse drawn 'carriage', though this is more of a tourist experience than a typical means of transportation.\n\nBicycle rental is also common, and an excellent way to explore the impressive palmerie. Test ride the bicycle before paying, and investigate if there are better\/newer bicycles then the one offered - you are rarely offered the best bicycle. Haggling and visiting several rental shops is recommended.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Nearby Villages"]},"\n\nMany people who come to Tozeur do so for the three abandoned villages nearby, Chebika, Tamerza, and Mides. These three villages are easily accessible through the numerous local tour operators who sell seats per person to these villages and many other local attractions. For a half day trip, expect to pay 30-35 dinar per person. The 4x4's hold 6+ people, so if you have a group of four or more, simply hire the whole 4x4 for yourself - about 120-150 dinar.\n\nThe allure of these three villages is that they were abandoned during floods in 1969, and offer a window to what life was like in oasis villages back then. In reality, the mud and stone buildings are unoccupied and falling down, tourists swarm the sites in hordes, and local children will offer to sell you crystals throughout your journey. The sites are still worthwhile, though the journey there may be more spectacular than the villages - you drive into the Atlas mountains, and are only 1 km from Algeria.\n\nMultiple natural swimming pools and waterfalls are along the drive. Bring swimming trunks and a towel.\n\nIf you do go, and are up for a hike, a beautiful 4.5 km gorge runs from Mides to Tamerza, and is worth the walk. Hiring a guide should cost no more than 40-50 dinar total (per guide), though they may price the hike per person. Syndicated, official guides may (or may not) be found at Mides, and\/or the Syndicat d'Initiative along the main road, which has various hours. Attempt to contact them before hand-one number given for them is 76-485-288. If you start the tour in the afternoon, begin the hike as early as possible, to allow for any problems or twisted ankles. The gorge will get dark long before the surrounding area.\n\nIf you do use a tour operator for transportation, it is recommended you pay half up front, and get a receipt that includes words like 'seatbelts' and 'driver speaks English' and anything else you find important. All this may be promised, but if you pay in advance in full, it will probably not be delivered.\n\nIf you have your own car, or a rental car, there is no reason you cannot do most, or all of this journey. All but a 100 m shortcut to Mides is on paved roads, and if you simply do not take the shortcut, you will be fine. Getting lost is nearly impossible, and following the massive number of tour companies will get you to the sites.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Star Wars  "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Tunisia_tozeur_mos_eisley_20101225-125321.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["right"],["The film set"]]},"\n\nThis site was used for multiple Star Wars movies.

Hours vary, as the local Hammams accommodate both men and women in a single Hammam, though not at the same time.\n\nHammam Shabia is recommended, and is just north of Hotel\/Residence El-Amen. Bring your own towel and soap, and bathing suit, as people wear this or their underwear in the Hammam. 2-3 dinar for the Hammam, and 2-4 dinar for a massage, though the 'tourist tax' may raise this price to about 8 dinar total for everything.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nTozeur has several restaurants that feature Camel, or Dromedarie.

Each leg should take just under 2 hours, though the wait in Kibilli may be 1-2 hours for another louage. Louages are more frequent before mid-day.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["33.9167"],["8.1333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Saharan Tunisia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Africa\/Tunisia\/Localities\/Tozeur\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Tozeur"]]}]
