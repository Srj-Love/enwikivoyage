Air charter companies fly point-to-point, at the time requested by hiring customers, so that customers don't need to wait in-line at major hub airports.  Safety, pilot qualifications, and many other considerations are overseen by the FAA. Air charter companies often fly smaller aircraft that the FAA approves, with room for 3-9 (or more) passengers.  Since aircraft with more than 9 passengers start to fall into the \"commuter\" size range, there are a number of extra requirements and costs that occur with more than 9 passenger seats per aircraft. The new VLJ (very light jet) aircraft being delivered by Eclipse Aviation and others will typically seat 4-5 passengers, and offer a new set of choices for point-to-point flights.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["General aviation"]},"\n\nTravelling at the controls of a small plane as a private pilot can be one of the most fulfilling travel experiences possible.  You get to see the world from a perspective entirely different from the ground or from commercial aviation.  Most parts of the world have some form of general aviation; in Western countries such as the United States and Europe small airports are everywhere.  Costs are somewhat higher than commercial airline seats; travel time is less than by car but usually somewhat more than by airline. On the other hand, when the costs of operating a light plane are shared between the pilot and passengers, it can be a surprisingly economical way of getting around.  Becoming a pilot can take a significant amount of time and money, but most will agree the rewards are outstanding; for most travel pilots the journey is the reward.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Rail travel"],["By train"]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["General information"]},"\n\nTravel by rail often invokes a past era, with tracks winding through mountains and forests, comforts including dining cars and sleeper cabins, and other amenities not available to air and motor travellers.\n\nFor more in-depth information see:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tips for rail travel"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Urban rail"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Boat travel"],["By boat"]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Freighter travel"]},"\nA less crowded, cheaper alternative for crossing a sea or ocean, not using airplanes or commercial cruise ships or ferries.

It is where you hire a yacht (either a sailing yacht or a motor yacht) and sail in a different part of the world each year. As well as the flexibility it offers it can also be surprisingly excellent value for money, often working out cheaper than booking hotel rooms, especially if there are a good number of people going on holiday together. It also usually works out cheaper than owning your own yacht if you charter for up to six weeks a year. In order to charter a yacht you will need to demonstrate that you have a qualified skipper and at least one competent member of crew. if you are not able to supply your own skipper (this is known as \"bare-boat charter\") you can pay to have one supplied which is known as a \"skippered\" or \"crewed\" charter.
