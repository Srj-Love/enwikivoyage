When you visit Transylvania you dive into a mix of cultures, nature and history. Transylvania is a diverse region: it is worth trying to observe the differences that exist within the region, both culturally and naturally. This region is a place with abundant history and multicultural convergence. All over Transylvania the cohabitation of Romanians, Hungarians, Saxons and Roma is the leading theme. Transylvania is rich in myth and misty medieval sites: there about 100 castles and fortresses and about 70 fortified churches. Romania's greatest and best preserved castles and fortresses are to be found here. But for the more curious traveler, there are many small villages with old houses and fortified churches. As Transylvania is circled by the Carpathian mountains there are a lot of mountain forests and hiking or climbing possibilities. All over the Carpathians there are great national parks. In the center of Transylvania there are green hills and rivers.  Most big cities are very western Europe like, and the infrastructure is generally good, making it easy for travelers. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap= WVoy_Transylvania-districts-map.png"],["regionmaptext=Regions in Transylvania"],["regionmapsize=450px"],["region1name=South-east"],["region1color=#0000FF"],["region1items=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sibiu County"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brașov County"]]}],["region1description=This region, with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sibiu"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brașov"]]},", has a more pronounced Saxon background.

Here you can find some of the most developed cities in Romania, but also old villages where people live as they did a hundred years ago. Transylvania is surrounded by the misty Carpathian mountains and is home to rare fauna (bears, wolves) and flora (orchids and other plants).\n\nTransylvania has all the history and multi-ethnic culture you could want. The history of Transylvania is much disputed: once it was an integral part of the Kingdom of Hungary (950-1526), then an independent Principality (1526-1690) before being reabsorbed by the Habsburg Empire. It was united with Wallachian and Moldovia to form Romania after the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dissolved in the Treaty of Triannon, which saw the conclusion of the Great War between Hungary and the Allies. This complex history explains the many cultural differences between Transylvania and the rest of Romania. For much of this history the Romanian majority had, few rights, and were ruled by minorities such as the Hungarians and Saxons. Other minorities included Roma, Jews and Armenians. After World War I, Transylvania became part of Greater Romania. The Communist era was a harsh time for ethnic minorities, especially for those of whom many had been small business owners (Hungarians, Jews) before the totalitarian regime came to power. After the revolution in 1989, most Saxons moved to Germany (having settled in Transylvania, at that time part of the Kingdom of Hungary, in large numbers during the 13th century), and many ethnic Hungarians also left.  The relations between the ethnic minorities and majority have known tense times, but there has never been a serious conflict. Although attitudes of individuals can still be closed towards other groups, Transylvania is an example of different ethnic groups living together in relative peace. However, as with Europe in general, the Roma ethnicity is still seriously discriminated against and their culture is little understood. \n\nToday Transylvania is the most developed region in Romania, partly because of tourism and partly because of a stronger capitalist tradition prior to World War II. The presence of the German and Hungarian minorities has been a catalyst for Western influences in Transylvania since 1989. It is interesting to observe the differences within this small region: the South and South East are dominated by Saxon culture, the East and North East are more influenced by Hungarian culture, the North is more Slavic, and the South West different again. Try to visit a few older villages, where the people are generally very friendly.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nNowadays, almost everyone in Transylvania speaks ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Romanian phrasebook"],["Romanian"]]},", though for many of the ethnic Hungarians -- about 20% of the population, but far more in certain areas -- ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hungarian phrasebook"],["Hungarian"]]}," is actually their first language.
