Some people wish to start the tour in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bucharest"]]},", Romania's capital, which is not in Transylvania but is the main Romanian entry point. If you start from Bucharest, travel from there to Brasov and back is ",{"type":"'''","value":["very"]}," easy, made possible by fast train connections hourly. The tour is triangular in that its \"corners\" are in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brasov"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oradea"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Timisoara"]]},", and the journey between these cities occurs in mostly straight lines.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Transylvania"]]}," is the region known around the world for Dracula, misty castles and medieval villages. The latter is true, although Dracula has for a long time been a (fairly) untrue stereotype. The Transylvanian Triangle Train Tour, due to its variety, enables you to see Romania's most developed region in all its forms - from wonderful rural areas, to medium-sized baroque towns to cosmopolitan cities, to medieval villages. The trip is also worth making due to the fact that you will meet local people and local culture, eat some of the best food you've ever eaten (trust us here, Transylvanian food is quite delicious) and partake in a journey that is quite significantly different from other parts of Europe yet still has that common sheen.\n\nThe political situation in Translyvania is quite stable even though it's been, along with Bucharest, Romania's most problematic technically. The Romanian Revolution of 1989 started here, in Timisoara, and since then there have been mild problems with the sizeable Hungarian minority, which is a majority in some (generally rural) areas. There is also a moderately large (i.e. less than 5%) Roma (Gypsy) minority. However, in years the Hungarians and the Romanians have gotten along with each other like they never have before, and there is very little chance of you encountering any real political or ethnic problems. That doesn't mean the Romanians don't joke about the Hungarians or vice versa, but these things are, in essence, the good humour that all Transylvanians share.\n\nYour journey will take you through fairly distinct \"mini-regions\" in terms of culture and history. Brasov and its surrounding region have a quite significant (but declining) ethnic German minority, and it is also home to mountain resorts such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sinaia"]]}," and medieval towns like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sighisoara"]]},", the birthplace of Vlad Ţepeş (the inspiration for Dracula). After you can visit the coffee culture, street theatre and cosmopolitan society of Sibiu (European Capital Of Culture-2007), the heartland of the German minority-which has the best museum in Romania (the Bruckenthal) and a very romantic medieval feel to it. Further on you reach the heart of Transylvania, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cluj-Napoca"]]},". It is situated near the Apuseni Mountains and is the largest and most cosmopolitan city in Transylvania. Here you will encounter a significant Hungarian minority and the opportunity to sample a taste (you can take that literally as well - Hungarian restaurants are plentiful) of Hungarian culture. Further on, the Apuseni Mountains is a beautiful rural area west of Cluj-Napoca, where you will see stunning scenery. This is the only rural region where you will stop over on your journey, and it's really worth seeing even though it won't appeal to everyone. Next on, you reach the Baroque towns of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oradea"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arad (Romania)"],["Arad"]]},", with their great cultural and historical spirit. Here you will see how architecture and culture were back in the Austro-Hungarian times. Onwards, you reach Timisoara, the heartland of the Banat province. Timisoara is one of the fastest-growing cities in Romania, and it is becoming an increasingly modern city, with many services everywhere. Even though it still offers history, Timisoara is definitely unique from all the other areas. After Timisoara, it is useful to return back north to Brasov, but on a different route, to complete the \"Triangle\". You will see the citadel city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alba Iulia"]]},", with its wonderful history and monasteries.\n\nThe tour is done by train because train captures the Transylvanian spirit best and makes for the best experience possible. Other possibilities include bus travel, which is getting increasingly popular in Transylvania but simply provides a way of getting from A to B with none of that charming experience associated with Romanian train travel. Car travel is also possible, but due to the not-so-good state of Romanian roads, this is best left alone. Therefore, train travel is both cheap and easy to use (you don't need to know any road directions or numbers, or any bus company contacts), and, for many people, it is a 'destination' within itself.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\nEven though Transylvania is a civilized destination with ample facilities, the nature of this itinerary is such that you will need to have at least some amount of self-sufficiency. Travel on trains is comfortable but not all that luxurious, so it's useful to pack snacks, etc. It's good to have water and food with you always; not so much in the larger cities (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cluj-Napoca"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oradea"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brasov"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Timisoara"]]},") but in the rural areas. However, it is valuable to eat in restaurants from time to time, because they're not all that expensive and serve great food.\n\nCitizens of the European Union, Canada, and the USA can travel to Romania visa-free for, so you won't have troubles - just present your passport when entering the country, and you're off; see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Romania#Get in"]]},", for details.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe starting point for the itinerary is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brasov"]]},", at the eastern extremity of Transylvania. The reason for this is that Brasov is very easily accessible. If you are already in Romania (in areas such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bucharest"]]},", the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Dobruja"],["Black Sea Coast"]]},", the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Painted Monasteries"]]},"), travel to Brasov is best done by train.

However, for visitors from other countries, it is best if you fly into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bucharest"]]}," and then catch an InterCity fast train to Brasov. The same applies at the end of your journey - if you want to see more of Romania, catch a train to Bucharest or another part of the country, or continue onwards to other countries either from Brasov directly (Brasov is an important railway center in Romania) or from Bucharest.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nIf you want to find out more about each destination, click on its link, which will take you to one of our specialized articles about the destination.
