Favourite local watering holes include the Saloon Bar at the bottom of Kay Street, where old classics and top 40s music is played well in to the morning. A huge dance floor and great beergarden make for a delightful evening's entertainment. There's also a deer head in the bar above the smaller dance floor, which speaks volumes of the townsfolk, as well as a couple of large mirrors opposite the main bar for the salmon-tinged, collar up t-shirt wearing country boys.\n\nIf it's a bogan infested, snooker playing, guaranteed broken jaw kind of setting you're after, then perhaps ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ryan's Hotel"]}," would be your place of preference. Recently renovated, the Hotel has undertaken quite a change of crowd in recent years, with Friday nights now primarily catering for a younger, more energetic crowd. Violence is still peaking in this venue, though everyone knows everyone anyway, so as long as you didn't sleep with Bazza's sister, or steal Wazza's parents lambs, you should be pretty safe. Great DJ also.\n\nIf you just want a decent Irish bar, go to Flanagan's, located on the corner of Hotham Street and the Princess Highway. Regular alcoholics rule the roost at this local favourite, though they are a friendly bunch, and a large number of poker machines sit adjacent to the building, awaiting your every last cent. A great beergarden is also a feature of this establishment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nin. There is no need for an early rise out here. Unless you were lucky enough to find some work on a local farm, whereby you would have no choice but to set the alarm for 3.30AM.\nTruths aside, Traralgon has an almost unneccesary amount of local hotels, and a shortage of beds is not a local issue.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=Australian Alphanumeric State Route A1.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eden (New South Wales)"],["Eden"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sale (Victoria)"],["Sale"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melbourne"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moe"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Traralgon"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-38.1833"],["146.5333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Central_Gippsland"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Oceania\/Australia\/Victoria\/Localities\/T\/Traralgon\/"]]}]
