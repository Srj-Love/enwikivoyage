From Ekamai buses run frequently throughout the day with the evening bus schedule less frequent at 17:30, 19:00, and then an overnight bus at 24:00. 1st Class is around 240 baht and the government-run bus has a nice 2nd class (air-con, but no toilet) for 188 baht.\n\nIf attempting to go to the border with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambodia"]]}," and continue on to Phnom Penh via one of the regular Cambodian bus services the same day, it is advisable to take one of the overnight buses from Bangkok to Trat. The overnight buses will arrive at the Trat bus depot very early in the morning and you can then catch the first morning mini-bus from the Trat bus depot to the border itself.  \n\nThe regular Cambodian buses that leave Koh Kong for Phnom Penh depart Koh Kong around 08:00, so in order to catch the bus you need to be across the border when it first opens in the morning or shortly thereafter. Taking a mid-day bus from Bangkok puts you into Koh Kong either too late to cross the border (not a 24 hr operation) the same day or too late to catch the bus to Phnom Penh. In these cases you will have to spend a night in a hotel on the Thai or Cambodian side before moving onward.\n\nTo go straight to the border by minivan to cross over to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Koh Kong"]]}," costs ~120 baht. \n\nRegular connections from Chanthaburi and other provincial capitals are also available from the Trat bus depot.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By share-taxi"]},"\nOn the east side of the main market building is the local share-taxi departure area.

Rentals of Honda and Yamaha motorbikes, in good condition, can be hired at the shop on Sukhumvit south of the market area (~200 baht). Drive south along Sukhumvit for about 45 minutes, and follow signs for the ferry quay. Be sure to top up with petrol before taking the ferry, as fuel prices on the island are rather high. Also, caution is required when driving on the island as the roads, although in excellent condition, are steep and winding, extremely so in some instances. (Furthermore, if taking your motorbike on the ferry you have no choice but to immediately go over the most dangerous hill, since it lies between the ferry piers and all the beaches. Carrying maps of Ko Chang and Trat province is advisable, as the routes are not always clear.\n\nCycle around the scenic lake which is just a few minutes cycle away from Trat town centre. Its about 10km around the lake and is scenic the whole way around. There are a few places to eat and drink as well. Hire a bicycle from Tattoo Guesthouse opposite Pop Guesthouse for 50 baht for all day. Use the bike also to go shopping at the huge Tesco Lotus supermarket on the edge of town. It has an excellent pharmacy.\n\nHave a 2 hour kick boxing lesson in the ring, at Tattoo Guesthouse.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Buy "]},"\nResident expats have set up a few used bookshops which provide English and German books at fair prices.
