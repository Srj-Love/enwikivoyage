It is also a major fruit-growing and fishing area.\n\nAbout 315 km from Bangkok and covering an area of 2,819 square km, the province is administratively divided into the districts of Mueang Trat, Khao Saming, Laem Ngop, Khlong Yai, and Bo Rai, and the sub-districts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Chang"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Kut"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nIt is thought that the name \"Trat\" is a corruption of “krat” which is the name of tree plentiful in Trat Province that is used in broom production.  In the Ayutthaya period during the reign of King Naresuan, the town was called \"Ban Bang Phra\".\n\nWhile King Rama V was on the throne, the Thai government entered into a treaty with France granting what is now Trat Province to France in exchange for France withdrawing its forces from Chanthaburi Province.  Later, on 23 Mar 1906, the king had to grant areas, namely Pratabong, Siem Reap, and Sri Sophon to France in exchange for Trat and the islands and towns on the right bank of Mekong River. Trat residents thus regard 23 Mar as \"Trat Independence Day\".  They also built a King Rama V monument at the city hall to commemorate the king's attempt to keep Trat with Thailand.\n\nOn 17 Jan 1941, during the war, a French squadron violated Thailand’s territorial waters.  A Thai flotilla came to defend its soverignty. Thus, the skirmish which was later to be known as the \"Ko Chang Naval Battle\" began. The Thai forces beat back the French incursion. The Thai side, however, lost three warships, namely the Songkhla, Chonburi, and Thonburi as well as some naval officers and ratings. Therefore, on this date every year, the Thai Navy holds a merit-making day dedicated to those who gave their lives in their effort to protect the country.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrom Bangkok, take one of these three routes:\n#Bang Na - Trat (Hwy 3) passing Chonburi – Rayong –Chanthaburi – Trat, a total distance of approximately 385 km. \n#Bang Na – Chon Buri – Klaeng – Chanthaburi – Trat (Hwy 344), a distance of approximately 318 km. \n#Motorway:  Start at km0 at the Sri Nagarind – Ramkhamhaeng intersection and drive the route Ban Bueng – Klaeng – Chanthaburi – Trat.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bangkokair.com Bangkok Airways"]}," has three daily flights from Bangkok (BKK) to Trat (TDX) at 08:40, 10:30, and 17:05.
