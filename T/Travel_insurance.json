Some insurance companies may require you to contact them before incurring any form of medical expense - they may have specific doctors and hospitals they will make arrangements with.  If you require emergency treatment or are taken to hospital, inform them as soon as possible.  Keep the expenses you incur to a minimum, and keep documentation for reimbursement. \n\nMost policies require a police report to be filed for any items lost or stolen, but can offer an alternative in some cases, which can be useful in countries where it costs money to file a police report.

Many insurers have a 24-hour hotline that you can call.  Often, this service is an advice hotline and the insurer may transfer you to their professional staff or those in your area to advise you about medical facilities and services available.

With some research, you should be able to find separate coverage for each.  If you need many types of coverage, you'll likely want an integrated policy that offers many kinds of \"protection\", some of which you may not need.  But its cost is likely to be significantly better than separately buying all that you need.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Medical expenses coverage "]},"\n\nUsually,  whatever standard health insurance you have will pay only claims for medical care in your country of residence.

However, even if a country extends its subsidized medical care to tourists, what's provided may not be up to your standards or needs.\n\nUnless you are covered by a reciprocal arrangement or your regular health insurance covers international medical expenses, you may have to pay all medical expenses incurred while traveling out of pocket or through help from your insurer; in many cases, quality medical care can be very expensive. Therefore, all international travelers should be certain that they have medical coverage via a travel insurance policy that covers medical expenses they unexpectedly incur on their trip.  Unless you'll not be far from home, you should also opt for medical evacuation coverage discussed below.\n\nSome hospitals may only admit you if you evidence of a travel insurance policy or proof that you can pay.\n\nWhen considering a travel insurance policy's medical coverage:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Check the precise details of medical care that you will be able to claim.

Medical coverage may not be permitted beyond a certain stage of pregnancy.  Different rules apply to multiple births, or IVF births.

Such people may not be able to travel secure of receiving affordable medical treatment for any condition at all.\n\nWhen medical coverage is refused, typically the other provisions of the policy still apply (e.g., claiming the replacement cost of stolen items).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Medical evacuation coverage "]},"\n\nA medical evacuation is often a chartered trip (usually a flight) for a patient who is not well enough to return home by other means to better facilities or to their home country. It typically involves traveling with medical personnel looking after you throughout the return home, along with any needed equipment, medications, etc. Though the need is rare, its costs can be devastating to most peoples' savings. On-balance, the cost of coverage is not terribly high.\n\nAlthough some travelers have worldwide medical coverage as part of their everyday health insurance, it ",{"type":"'''","value":["virtually NEVER comes with international medical evacuation"]},". Even if you are willing to forgo all other types of international travel-related insurance, ",{"type":"'''","value":["NOBODY should ignore medical evacuation coverage"]},".\n\nThere are multiple reasons a traveler would need medical evacuation. In simple cases, after local treatment, you may only require medical monitoring, possibly on a commercial flight in first or business class to provide for more room. In moderate cases (after hospitalization), you may be just well enough to travel with medical assistance while lying down, but not well enough to use a commercial airliner--especially if you have or had a communicable disease. If jumbo jet travel is possible, five seats in a row may be removed to allow you to remain laying down during the flight. Either you or the insurance company pay for all five. Though much cheaper than exclusive medical evacuation, it's reported to be quite uncomfortable.\n\nSome less-developed countries or the hinterlands of most countries may have no capabilities to treat serious injuries or illnesses. You might need to be immediately evacuated to the nearest suitable hospital for treatment, only to later be evacuated to your home country. The total price for this type of \"double evacuation\" can be extremely high, especially if the first hospital is relatively distant, and you're still very far from home.\n\nSupplemental insurance (such as AFLAC in the USA) may cover medical evacuation, but only for about US$3,000. This is woefully inadequate for international travel. Domestic \"medi-evac\" is only intended to partly cover airlift to the nearest hospital (such as a helicopter serving an auto accident outside a major city), rather than evacuation to your home country while abroad. Make sure your policy covers at least US$300,000 or equivalent, and seriously consider opting for US$1,000,000 coverage.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Caretaker coverage "]},"\n\nIf you are incapacitated while traveling, some policies will pay for a relative or friend to travel to you and either stay with you or escort you home.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Lump sum payments "]},"\n\nIn addition to covering your medical expenses if you are ill or injured, some policies will pay a lump sum to you or your estate in the event of an accident or untoward event. For example, they may pay you a fraction of your salary for a certain time if you are injured while traveling and unable to work.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Cancellation "]},"\n\nTravel insurance will often cover expenses related to unexpected cancellations by your carrier or destination providers, e.g., costs associated with a canceled flight, including accommodation, meals and other incidentals. Cancellations due to emergencies are often also covered, some possible examples include the following:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Medical advice telling you that you cannot travel"]},{"type":"*","value":[" A death or (sometimes) medical emergency in your family"]},{"type":"*","value":[" A major disaster at home such as a house fire"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Disasters or upheavals at your planned destination that occur after you booked your trip"]},"\nDepending on what's happened, the insurer might pay re-booking fees, refund lost deposits, or pay for travel home. Travel insurance pays only for direct losses such as these; you won't get additional compensation for things like your disappointment at your holiday being cancelled.\n\nMore expensive policies may also cover your own discretionary cancellations if there is an exceptional circumstance: for example, there are some travel insurance policies that will pay you the cost of your ski lift tickets if a resort has shut due to lack of snow.\n\nThere are always a raft of conditions about acceptable and unacceptable cancellations. Some examples of troublesome situations:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" You can purchase insurance covering a trip home because of the death of a family member, but a trip home due to the death of a friend almost certainly won't be covered, and even a de facto partner's death might not be;"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Family medical emergencies other than a death often aren't covered; for example the insurance might not cover a trip home to be with a family member who has been hospitalized or diagnosed with cancer – even if it's your own child;"]},{"type":"*","value":[" If the family member's emergency isn't in the same city as from where you departed, you'll have to pay any difference in fare, if higher.

When considering claiming for damage, check the terms carefully: many expensive and fragile items are only covered if damaged while being carried by you. It is very common to exclude any damage done to your belongings if they travel as checked luggage: you must keep them on your person to be covered.

The precise cutoff for receiving insurance without an addition premium and\/or medical examinations varies from 55 to over 70 for some insurers.

It is generally much easier to extend a policy if you request the extension while you're still covered: obtaining a policy when you're traveling but aren't presently insured is difficult. In addition, if you let your policy lapse you will obviously not be covered for anything, including medical expenses, while you arrange a new policy. Many policies require that you apply for an extension at least 7 days before your policy expires.\n\nWhen planning a trip, pay for your policy to cover a few days after your intended return. In the event of last-minute delays or changes of plan which extend your trip, you then have a few days to sort out any extension of the policy you need. Some policies will automatically extend if the delay is part of a problem that you could claim for: for example, if you have insured against delays and the delay extends your travel past the end of your coverage, the policy is automatically extended. This will typically not apply to pre-existing conditions or to high risk travelers such as the elderly, even if you fully disclosed pre-existing conditions when applying for cover.\n\nExtensions to your policy are never guaranteed to happen. They will always be at the discretion of the insurer and may be refused based on your previous claims and any other information that you disclose when applying for the extension (and you will usually be required to disclose anything you think might be relevant lest the policy be void).

Medical problems that occur during your holiday may count as pre-existing conditions when applying for an extension and certainly will if applying for a second policy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Example tables of coverage"]},"\nIn concert with the above discussions, these tables reflect coverages under three kinds of ",{"type":"''","value":["multi-coverage policies"]}," currently offered by one reputable insurer.
