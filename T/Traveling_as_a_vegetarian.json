You should request the vegetarian meal at the time of your reservation, and to be sure reconfirm with the airline 72 hours before departure. If you book online and there is no option to select your meal, you should call the airline. If you forget at the time of booking, there is little prospect of requesting one at check-in; however, it always pays to ask on the plane, as often there can be a spare meal that meets your requirements. If not, the meal without the heated component can often be vegetarian. Be warned that in economy class, vegetarian meals served on airplanes are often nothing but overcooked steamed or boiled vegetables without seasoning.\n\nFull service airlines use codes internally with their caterers to select meal types.  The codes applicable to vegetarians and vegans are:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" VGML - Strict\/Pure Vegetarian (Vegan) - Usually the default vegetarian special meal."]},{"type":"*","value":[" VLML - Lacto-Ovo Vegetarian \/ Western Vegetarian"]},{"type":"*","value":[" AVML - Asian Vegetarian - Spicy Indian food"]},{"type":"*","value":[" VJML - Vegetarian Jain Meal (Vegan)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" VOML - Chinese Vegetarian (Vegan)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" RVWL - Raw Vegetarian (Vegan)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" FPML - Fruit Platter (Vegan)."]},"\nAt airports removed from the airline's home ports the food can depend more on the catering available at the remote airport than the airline.  Sometimes the different vegetarian styles will give different meals, but it is quite common for a VGML to be served, even if you order a VLML.\n\nDiscount airlines, and some full service airlines on short sectors do not serve food or have food sold from a trolley.  Usually there is a vegetarian option, but you can usually check the inflight menu in advance on the website, or third party sites that have meal information.\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact of flying that sometimes the full service airline loses a meal order, or the salad sandwich on the discount airline is sold out, or not available on a flight.  It's always a good idea to take snacks on board just in case.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Other information "]},"\n\nThere are some cities in the world that are completely vegetarian.
