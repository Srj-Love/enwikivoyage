[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\nThere isn't a single, authoritative source to consult on travelling with a criminal history but, for many countries, the information can be found on the relevant country's immigration agency website or by searching legislation. \n\nMany countries don't welcome criminals for obvious reasons, but which criminal history is relevant and the period that must have elapsed since a past conviction varies from country to country. For some countries, particularly Canada and the US, even a minor criminal conviction 50 years ago can cause you to be refused entry, while others would require a conviction for a violent or serious crime to be refused entry. This page also lists ways (if known) to circumvent a bar on entry due to a criminal history.\n\nIn general it is very difficult if not impossible to travel to any country if you have violent or repeat criminal convictions in the past, or if the conviction is very recent. Some countries prohibit their own citizens from leaving if they have serious criminal histories. However, in general, the authorities are not concerned about petty offences. \n\nIf you are on probation or parole you must follow the travel policies set by your probation officer to the letter, as leaving the country (or even your locality in certain countries) without permission will result in a violation. Generally offences committed in the destination country count more than offences committed outside of their country.\n\nRequirements vary with the type of visa. All countries that issue ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Retiring_abroad#Retirement visa"],["retirement visas"]]}," require a criminal background check, basically a letter from police in your home country saying you have a clean record, and many countries require that for working, immigration or student visas as well. For a tourist visa, few if any countries check that carefully, but many do ask about criminal history, at least sometimes.\n\nIf you are asked about your criminal convictions, you must (and generally should) answer truthfully. Any false statements could result in a lengthy or permanent bar to entering that country, particularly the USA or Canada. Other countries, like the UK and its former colonies, have a concept of \"spent\" convictions that do not have to be declared once the conditions for \"spent convictions\" have been met, and that is about the only time you can get away with not answering truthfully.\n\n=Africa=\n\n=Americas=\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["United States"]},"\nThe United States of America is generally very strict with criminal records, no matter how minor or how long ago it has been. They do not have any concept of \"spent\" or \"pardoned\" convictions, meaning you must truthfully answer any questions about criminal convictions even if your convictions have been spent or pardoned in your country. For citizens of any country who are eligible for the Visa Waiver Program, being convicted of any crimes, having proceedings pending, or even a previously refused visa makes you ineligible for the visa waiver program!\n\nThere are numerous crimes that render you ineligible to enter the US, and these include \"crimes involving moral turpitude\", among other things. There is only a loose definition of \"crimes involving moral turpitude\" and the actual offenses are ever changing. Some of them may be minor such as shoplifting, while others can be very serious such as murder. The actual penalty for the conviction does not matter. If you are convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, then you are ineligible to enter the US and little relief exists for this. \n\nStrangely, an exception to this is \"purely political offences.\" Again, this is also a very loose definition that the immigration officer can interpret anyway he wants. Being convicted of an \"aggravated felony\" is even worse, though just like crimes involving moral turpitude, these also have a very loose definition, therefore the offences can change over time. However, there is absolutely no relief, and anyone deported or excluded for this reason cannot ever enter the US.\n\nDo not even attempt to enter the US if you have been previously deported without a proper visa! Doing so is a felony (and a serious felony at that) under US law, and is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Do not lie about your convictions when questioned, as chances are they will find out. The US conducts extensive security checks on all visa applicants.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["w:Moral turpitude"],["moral turpitude"]]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.state.gov\/documents\/organization\/86942.pdf official guidance as at 2013"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Canada"]},"\nWhile Canada's policies on criminal record are strict (any convictions no matter how minor or how long ago makes you inadmissible) it is possible to overcome the inadmissibility by submitting an application for \"rehabilitation\". This process can take a long time and requires numerous references to prove that you are in fact rehabilitated and that further offences are unlikely. If you do not want to wait that long and must go to Canada you may be able to apply for a temporary resident permit, however the reason must be justified and vacations are not considered a justified reason.\n\nIf you have been convicted of driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs, you will probably be found criminally inadmissible to Canada as this is an offence under Canada's Criminal Code.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cic.gc.ca\/english\/information\/inadmissibility Frequently Asked Questions for criminal inadmissibility to Canada"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Character concerns"]},"\nAll potential visitors, whether applying for a temporary resident visa or requesting landing permission at the border must be of good moral character, and under Canadian law this means having a completely clean criminal history. Any offence, misdemeanour or felony, regardless of how minor or how long ago it took place could exclude you from Canada for a period of time or indefinitely.  Some US citizens have been turned back while attempting to drive across the border. Even former US President George W.

More serious offences (\"felonies\" in US law, \"indictable offences\" in Canadian or British law) may require you to wait up to ten years, or in the most serious cases obtain a pardon or other civil relief locally before applying for entry. Some relatively minor infractions in other countries (minor drug possession tickets in countries where they are not handled through the criminal system, or drunk driving in jurisdictions which treat this as a simple traffic violation) are considered criminal convictions for the purpose of immigration law, as Canada's Criminal Code treats these as crimes. With the exception of crimes of conscience, even if you were prosecuted for an offence in that country which would not have been an offence in Canada, it would result in you being inadmissable. Even if you were never arrested, charged with a crime or sentenced it is possible to be turned away by a border guard on suspicion of criminal activity. Additionally, you cannot enter Canada if there are current charges pending against you or a trial is under way.\n\nAlthough unlikely as a visitor who meets all other entry requirements, you may also be refused if you have significant unpaid debt, have an active civil judgement against you, or have recently declared bankruptcy. This is more likely to be an issue if your nationality requires a visa to enter Canada. In these cases, you can regain your ability to enter Canada by either paying the debt in full, showing evidence of a payment plan in good standing or after a bankruptcy showing a history of financial solvency over the period of a few years.\n\nOffences committed before the age of 18, parking tickets, local ordinance violations and crimes of conscience (such as publishing statements critical of the government in China) generally do not result in inadmissibility. Similarly, non-criminal traffic tickets usually do not result in inadmissibility, although if you were ever ",{"type":"''","value":["required"]}," to appear in court over a traffic violation (not simply going to court to challenge a ticket) or you accumulated enough points that your license was summarily suspended or revoked, you may be inadmissible and should contact a Canadian embassy or high counsel for advice.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Rehabilitation"]},"\nIf you have a single misdemeanour or summary offence on your record and it's been at least five years since you finished your sentence, and your offence would be punished with a prison term of 10 years or less in Canada, you can be ",{"type":"'''","value":["deemed rehabilitated"]}," on the spot by an immigration officer without formally applying in advance.

While you can compile the documentation and submit the application yourself, both CIC and many who have gone through the process highly advise retaining an immigration attorney to complete and file the application on your behalf.

Minor issues (such as an occasional late credit card payment) are not a major concern.
