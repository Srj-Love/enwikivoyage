It can add interest to family time together away from the pressures of work and education.   You can gain different perspectives on places when travelling in a group with children.  It is often easier to get to meet local people, people can be friendlier, and when picking educational experiences for children you often learn something yourself.\n\nHowever, it also often means extra preparation to ensure that you can all enjoy the experiences.  You have to balance the needs of everyone in the group, and try and avoid many of the additional expenses that can apply to travelling as a group.  You may have to deal with bored children in airports or on long trips, extra luggage when they get tired, and some frustration when they complain after going to all the planning effort when you could have left them at home with the grandparents.\n\nLuckily, when you return home the crisis times seem to fade, and the memories of the activities together get remembered.\n\nMake sure your kids are well rested before any long distances of travel. You do not want to bring a tired and grumpy child through security, or have them squirming and complaining in the coach or car. Do not overfeed your kids before a trip either. You do not want to get up every ten minutes to go to the bathroom with them and you do not want them to vomit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Who qualifies as a child?

There may also be minimum or maximum weight and height restriction on some attractions for safety purposes. It is also worth noting that often the definition of a child will differ for hotels, flights and travel insurance. For example while generally we accept that someone may be considered a child up to the age of 18, travel insurance may sometimes let a child remain on a parents travel policy well into their 20's, depending on whether they are full-time students etc.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Infants and toddlers"]}," under 3 to 5 years. – often no charge."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Children"]}," under about 12 or sometimes 14 years – child rates normally apply."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Young People\/Teenagers"]},"  14 to 18 years – child rates may apply in some cases."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Young Adults"]}," 18 and up – full-time students under 26 can qualify for discounts with an International Student ID."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Destinations "]},"\n\nThe individual guides include child prices for attractions and transport.

The less time you spend walking through airports and clearing security check points, the better. You are going to have to carry plenty of extra baggage, and this will become a nuisance if you have to keep unpacking. A crowded airport is full of stimuli that can upset\/ excite\/ bewilder a young child, so travelling at a quieter time will make the journey easier.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tickets"]},"\n\nAge policy around child and infant tickets varies between airlines. As a general rule ",{"type":"'''","value":["children under 2"]}," often have the option of traveling sitting on your lap and not being assigned a seat. Lap infants can travel free on domestic flights in some countries and sometimes at a 10% fare on international flights. Airport and government charges are usually not applied to children under 2, thereby reducing ticket price further.\n\nDuring take-off and landings infants on your lap should be held in an upright position facing you and against you, with your hands supporting their back and neck. Some infants are more comfortable ",{"type":"'''","value":["nursing"]}," during these periods and most flight attendants will allow it. Saving a feed for the descent can make the baby much more comfortable. With some carriers a ",{"type":"'''","value":["lap belt"]}," is available that loops into the adult belt and then around the lap infant for take-off and landings.\n\nConsider putting infants with their own seat in an approved car seat appropriate for their age and weight. This is compulsory n the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["USA"]]},", and recommended in other jurisdictions. Still, best to confirm with your airline about it, as some airlines try to restrict carry-on, and other airlines will not permit an unsupported infant in a seat without a car-seat.\n\nSome airlines do not have the facilities for infants to be booked through their website, and you must contact the call center or a travel agent. Your infant is recognized as an individual passenger on a flight and therefore you must book their ticket before flying. Turning up at an airport with an infant who has no ticket will cause difficulties at check-in.\n\nInfants younger than two weeks may require a certificate from a doctor saying they are able to fly.\n\nIf you have infants under 2 years old on a long-haul flight you may be able to request a ",{"type":"'''","value":["bassinet"]}," (baby bed) which attaches to the bulkhead. Needless to say, this can make long flight much more comfortable for the parent and child. The age, height and weight requirement for using a bassinet depends on the airline. Requirements are usually listed on the airline's website. There are also limited bassinet seating options depending on the aircraft itself. If you check-in after they have been allocated then it will unfortunately not be an option for you.\n\nFor older infants, consider a ",{"type":"'''","value":["bulkhead seat"]}," Arm rests don't go up (the tray is in the armrest), and you have to stow your carry-on bags in the overhead compartment during take-off and landing since there is no seat in front of you. On the plus side, bulkhead seats have more legroom, often enough for moving around without disturbing the occupant of the aisle seat, and there is no seat in front for the child to kick. Some airlines will let you book these when you purchase tickets, others give them out at a first-come-first-served basis at check-in only.   Airlines won't let you place infants on the floor at your feet to sleep.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Children between 2 and 12"]}," must have their own ticket.  Children this age are usually given a discounted rate (typically 75% of the adult fare) on full service international airlines, but usually have no discount on discount international or domestic airlines.  Discounted children's tickets may have different baggage allowances so check before showing up. Children's meals are available on some flights offering meals.  The usual rules for special meals apply, and they must be ordered in advance.  Picky eaters may prefer a bag lunch. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Unaccompanied children"]}," are usually children under 12 traveling without a supervising adult.  Not all airlines accept unaccompanied children, especially discount airlines.  An unaccompanied child may be required to travel on a full adult fare, and additional fees may be charged.  Unaccompanied children will need to be collected at their destination by a named caregiver and may be returned to their point of departure if not collected.  Some airlines do not permit connections and no airlines permit connections to different airlines. In Russia a special official document is necessary that states that the child has permission to travel alone. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Seat allocation"]}," is important.  At a minimum you want to be seated next to your child, but few airlines will actually guarantee that you are.  Make sure you and your child are on a single reservation.  Try and reserve your seats in advance, if the airline or agent permit it.  Check-in early, and if you are not seated together make sure the flight manager is aware you are travelling with a child.  If you still can't get a seats together, just make sure you get a window or an aisle seat, as these are easy to swap on board, whereas swapping a centre seat can be a nightmare.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["At the airport"]},"\n\nAirports often have play areas as well as nursery or parent rooms with changing tables and rocking chairs for nursing.\n\nParents with smaller children can keep their hands free with a ",{"type":"'''","value":["baby sling"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["baby backpack"]},". Slings can be used on the plane with small infants and can give some privacy when nursing.  Many parents find a ",{"type":"'''","value":["stroller"]}," a life saver when flying. Some airports and airlines will let you keep a stroller with you until boarding, and the stroller is brought to the gate at arrival.  Some airlines allow one stroller to be check at the gate in addition to normal baggage allowances.\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" In the air "]},"\nOnce in the air, flight attendants should be able to heat milk or water for a ",{"type":"'''","value":["bottle"]},", and point out which lavatories have ",{"type":"'''","value":["changing tables"]},". Pack a small grab-bag with one or two diapers and wipes for changing, since there's not a lot of room to move around in the lavatories and you won't want to bring your whole diaper bag. Flights with meals can include an infant meal with ",{"type":"'''","value":["baby food"]},", but you'll want to bring some favorite snacks in case this is not available. \n\nYoung infants are often content to nurse and sleep through a flight, while older babies will require some ",{"type":"'''","value":["entertainment"]},". Bring small bags of snacks and toys and dole them out every 10–15 minutes so there's always something new to play with. Small amounts of playdough, books, and crayons are good ideas. Avoid anything messy or with small parts that can get lost under foot. Anything too noisy will probably not be appreciated by other travellers. Take ",{"type":"'''","value":["walks"]}," up and down the aisle every half hour or so and look for other babies and young children. Making a friend (and talking with other parents) can make the flight go faster.\n\nFlying in a group can be fun as children can keep each other busy. On a large plane such as a Boeing 747 or Airbus A380, you will want to reserve the four seats in the middle. The armrests move up allowing for children to sleep. Another option if you're flying Air New Zealand (and shortly China Airlines) is the Skycouch: a row of three economy seats which can convert into a flat \"couch\" by raising the legrests and retracting the armrests. It costs extra, and is not available on all aircraft models and flights, but it does give more room for children to lay down than buying regular economy seats. On smaller planes pair one parent or old child with younger children and make sure everyone is supervised at all times.\n\nTime also passes more quickly for children with video entertainment, like a familiar TV show for younger children.\n\nIf trans-continental flights seem too long for children, try planning a stopover or two in between. For example, Air Canada has a five-hour flight from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. John's"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newfoundland"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," Heathrow for a trans-Atlantic trip. Trans-Pacific flights are a bit more challenging, but ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hawaii"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guam"]]}," (or in some cases, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anchorage"]]},", Alaska) are possibilities. Look at a round globe (not a flat map) for more ideas. Keep in mind this will involve more take-offs and landings, as well as getting from one flight to another, so it's a trade off. In addition, it will probably cost a lot more as well, especially if you can't keep the trip to just one airline and its affiliates.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["By car"]},"\nSome countries require children to travel in appropriate child car seats when travelling by car. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Tips for a long car trip "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Try to break the trip up into small sessions.
