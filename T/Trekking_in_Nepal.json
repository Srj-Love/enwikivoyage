The huge variety of options allows for people of many ages and capabilities to attempt a trek in the country. While you could spend a year planning an expedition to wild and lofty places that few would dare attempt, you could also arrive in Kathmandu with no plans and be on the trail in a matter of days.\n\nDespite what many may perceive, trekking in Nepal is not necessarily wandering alone through an uncharted wilderness. As they walk along the well-marked trekking paths, travellers will often discover quite the opposite; hundreds of locals passing through each day as they haul food, water and other odd necessities back to their tiny villages, along with dozens of fellow trekkers. The regularly-spaced villages and teahouses allow trekkers good opportunities to rest and recover, either for a few minutes or the night. The strong culture and unreserved friendliness of the Nepalese people can also be witnessed as one traverses the hill tracks.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Nepal - Sagamartha Trek - 181 - Khumbu Glacier (4434702615).jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Khumbu Glacier on the Sagamartha Trek"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["When to go"]},"\nThe best seasons for trekking are the dry and warm seasons, March-June and September-November. During these times, the temperature is bearable and skies are usually clear, although the skies are foggier and the rain begins in May-June. It is possible to trek out of season, but expect lots of rain and leeches during the summer monsoon season and severe cold and closed passes during the winter months. See also the Nepal ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nepal#Climate"],["climate"]]}," section.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Experience & Fitness"]},"\nThere are treks suitable for a wide range of experience and physical fitness. If you can walk uphill for a few hours each day, then you can find a suitable trek in Nepal. An easy trek with Nepali support (guide\/porter) and teahouse accomodation is quite attainable for anyone who is reasonably fit. Longer treks, crossing high passes and into remote regions demand a higher degree of endurance. For Trekking Peaks, i.e. summitting a mountain of 5650-6500m, it is desirable to have some alpine climbing experience.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Equipment and Supplies"]},"\nIt is best to take only what you need and leave the rest behind. Your needs while trekking will be simple. \n\nIt is possible to buy or rent everything you need in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thamel"]]}," neighborhood of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kathmandu"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pokhara"]]},", although it is better to use footwear that is already broken in. Good bargains can be had on fleeces and down jackets but the knockoffs of brand name goods sold in Nepal are not good quality.\n\nThe main essentials to bring are sturdy and comfortable hiking boots, a sleeping bag (depending on your accommodation), a daypack, and a few changes of clothes for the varying temperatures. For cold weather, hiking pants, thermals, gloves, neck warmer\/scarf, beanie, a warm inner jacket and a windproof \/ waterproof outer jacket are essential. Other items to bring include a hiking stick or two, waterproof case, fabric bandages such as moleskin, a headlamp, water purification supplies, altitude sickness and other medication, a camera, and binoculars.\n\nOn the popular trekking routes, everyday supplies, such as toilet paper, soap, chocolate bars, and even basic hiking supplies can be purchased along the way, though prices rise dramatically as you go higher in elevation. Try to stock up lower down and buy locally-produced products such as fruit, coconut biscuits and bon bon biscuits.\n\nMaps are easy to find in Nepal, although they may not be totally accurate.\n\nFor the more difficult treks involving mountaineering, crampons and ice axes may be required.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Guided vs. Independent Treks"]},"\nWhether to join an organized group, trek unguided with other independent travelers, or to hire your own guide and\/or porter is a personal decision to be based on the difficulty of the trek and available budget. When signing up with an agency, you should speak with several and make detailed inquiries about the differences in service besides just the base cost. If hiring staff independently and without an agency, the be mindful of your responsibilities to ensure that your guide is suitably equipped for the job and stays safe. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Guided Treks"]}," legally must be organized through ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.taan.org.np\/ TAAN"]}," registered trekking agencies in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kathmandu"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pokhara"]]},". Be aware that no one else, no hotel, no street broker, no nice person you just met, not even a trekking guide is legally authorized to organize a trek. During the main seasons the agencies run regular group treks and it is generally easy to find a group doing the trek of your choice. All the necessary trekking gear, food, fuel and other goods are carried by the porters. The cook will prepare all the meals during the camping trek. Trekkers need to carry only a small bag as required for the day. At night, tents for dining, sleeping and washing are provided and set up. Mattresses, sleeping bags, tables and seating are arranged by staff. For large group treks, a Sirdar (chief guide) is employed to pre-arrange and then to oversee the entire program. All land transportation, local permits, taxes, porter insurance, port dues and entrance fees to National Parks or sites that are part of the trip are arranged by the agency.\n\nRecommendations from others you might know who have used the services of guides or trekking companies can be very helpful.  Obviously some guides or trekking organizations provide better and more professional services than others.  This could affect merely your convenience and comfort or, when significant altitude gain or a difficult route is involved, could become a real safety issue. Having someone along who is experienced, professional and attentive could be very important.\n\nIf you are employing the services of guides and porters, it is customary to present a tip to the head guide at the end of the trip. This will be divided up between the various people employed in your group.  Like most tips, the amount will vary depending on the quality of services provided, but it could be between 5% and 10% of the total cost of your trek.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Independent trekking"]}," is quite easy in the main trekking areas.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Required Permits"]},"\nPolice check points are numerous and unavoidable and park officers can check your permits at any time, with a fine of double the normal cost if you are caught without the proper permits.

There are two types of TIMS cards: green (for independent trekkers, NPR2,000) and blue (for trekkers who are part of a group with a guide, NPR1,000). Individual TIMS (green cards) are obtainable only from Nepal Tourism Board offices in Kathmandu and Pokhara and from the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal office. Not even Trekking Agents are legally authorized to obtain individual TIMS (even though some small Trekking Agents may offer the individual TIMS).
