The country is the most industrialised and one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean. Overall, tourism is not a major industry (though the island of Tobago has proportionally more), leaving the islands replete with natural unspoiled beauty not found in most other Caribbean countries.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThe islands were first inhabited by Arawak and Carib people, who settled here from the South American mainland, and whose descendants make up a small minority of the population. Trinidad was discovered by Christopher Columbus, who claimed it for Spain. Under Spanish rule, large numbers of French settlers established cocoa plantations in Trinidad and imported slaves to work them. The British seized the island in 1798, and abolished slavery. To make up for the labor shortage the government encouraged heavy immigration from countries such as Portugal, France, Germany, China, and most importantly India. Trinidad was united with Tobago in the 1880s. Throughout the early 1900s the country welcomed thousands of mostly black immigrants from other Caribbean countries, as well as Venezuela and Colombia. Following World War II, TT was combined with various other British Caribbean countries into the West Indies Federation, but the different countries could not get along and the federation soon collapsed. TT eventually achieved complete independence on August 31, 1962. Throughout the sixties and seventies, the country prospered thanks to large deposits of oil and natural gas, becoming the wealthiest nation in the Caribbean. However, in the late eighties, oil prices dropped significantly, causing a major economic meltdown. Thousands of Trinidadians left the country at this time, in search of better opportunities elsewhere. Throughout the nineties and 2000's the country recovered dramatically and it continues to improve today.\n\nThe country has a cosmopolitan society inhabited by many different peoples and cultures who live together in relative peace and harmony.\n\nThe two islands have distinct personalities. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trinidad"]]}," is the larger of the two, and is the location of most of the country's cities and activity.

Both islands have a share of natural beauty.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nTrinidad and Tobago, well within the tropics, both enjoy a generally pleasant maritime tropical climate influenced by the northeast trade winds. In Trinidad the annual mean temperature is 26 째C (78.8 째F), and the average maximum temperature is 34 째C (93.2 째F). The humidity is high, particularly during the rainy season, when it averages 85 to 87 %. The island receives an average of 2,110 millimeters (83.1 in) of rainfall per year, usually concentrated in the months of June through December, when brief, intense showers frequently occur. Precipitation is highest in the Northern Range, which may receive as much as 3,810 millimeters (150 in). During the dry season, drought plagues the island's central interior. Tobago's climate is similar to Trinidad's but slightly cooler. Its rainy season extends from June to December; the annual rainfall is 2,500 millimeters (98.4 in). The islands lie outside the hurricane belt; despite this, Hurricane Flora damaged Tobago in 1963, and Tropical Storm Alma hit Trinidad in 1974, causing damage before obtaining full strength.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Terrain"]},"\nTrinidad is traversed by three distinct mountain ranges.  The Northern Range, an outlier of the Andes Mountains of Venezuela, consists of rugged hills that parallel the coast. This range rises into two peaks. The highest, El Cerro del Aripo, is 940 meters (3,084 ft) high; the other, El Tucuche, reaches 936 meters. The Central Range extends diagonally across the island and is a low-lying range. The Caroni Plain, extends southward, separating the Northern Range and Central Range. The Southern Range consists of a broken line of hills with a maximum elevation of 305 meters (1,001 ft). There are numerous rivers and streams on the island of Trinidad; the most significant are the Ortoire River, and Caroni River.\n\nTobago is mountainous and dominated by the Main Ridge, which is 29 kilometers long with elevations up to 640 meters. There are deep, fertile valleys running north and south of the Main Ridge. The southwestern tip of the island has a coral platform. Although Tobago is volcanic in origin, there are no active volcanoes.  There are numerous rivers and streams, but flooding and erosion are less severe than in Trinidad.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=Trinidad and Tobago Regions map.png"],["regionmapsize=475px"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trinidad"]]}],["region1color=#71B37B"],["region1description="],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tobago"]]}],["region2color=#B383B3"],["region2description="]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port-of-Spain"]]}," - Capital city"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Fernando"]]}," - Southern city"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scarborough (Trinidad and Tobago)"],["Scarborough"]]}," (Capital of Tobago)"]},"\nBoroughs:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arima"]]}," - birthplace of famous calypso artiste \"Lord Kitchener\""]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chaguanas"]]}," - fastest growing and largest municipality mostly populated by descendants of East Indian indentured labourers"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Point Fortin"]]}," - south western municipality, which lies on the outskirts of the La Brea Pitch Lake and is known for oil production"]},"\nTowns:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chaguaramas"]]}," - a town with one of the major yachting centres, also famous for nightlife; venue of the 1999 Miss Universe Pageant."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Princes Town"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toco"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" St. James - fondly known by locals as the city that never sleeps"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Caroni Bird Sanctuary and former sugar cane estates (very nice place to watch birds, many mosquitoes)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" North coast beaches (Maracas, Las Cuevas, Tyrico, Blanchisseuse) "]},{"type":"*","value":[" La Brea Pitch Lake"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Lopinot Historical Site - museum built on former Cocoa estate owned by French Count Charles Joseph de Lopinot"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Roxborough - Northern Tobago, tropical rainforest reserve"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Down the Islands - the small islands off the north-west peninsula offer a calm retreat."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Entry requirements"]},"\n\nA passport valid for the length of the stay.

However, their license plates start with the letter \"H\".  They are found at Taxi stands which may be at a street corner or at the side of the road.  Taxi stands in the cities and boroughs are usually marked, but outside of the city they are not.  However, one can hail a taxi from the side of the road and ask where they are going and the fare before hiring the taxi.  One pays for an individual seat and the taxicabs are shared, but a whole car can be hired if so desired, and if there are not a lot of passengers waiting.  Airport taxis are an exception to this in that one almost always has to hire the whole car.  \n\nThere are larger taxis, called \"Maxi Taxis\" or simply \"Maxis\" that go along a specified route.  These are similar to mini buses and are painted white or beige and have a colored band around them.  Each maxi usually holds approximately 11 or 25 passengers.  The colour of the band indicates the area in which they travel.  They have their own taxi stands and terminals.  In Port of Spain, the maxis depart and arrive at the City Gate terminal, and in San Fernando they depart and arrive at the bus terminal at King's Wharf. These Maxi Taxis travel to the east, south and central areas of the island. In order to travel to the west there are a few designated areas such as the Diego martin\/Petit Valley\/Carenage\/Chagaramas maxi stand located a few kilometers away from City Gate.  If so desired, a maxi taxi can be hired for a whole day on a chartered trip.  These can be negotiated directly with the maxi taxi drivers in advance.  Prices vary.  \n\nGypsy cabs are available as well. Locally they are called \"PH\" because they are private cars illegally used for hire.

There are several companies that rent cars including international chains such as Budget and Hertz.  There are also local companies such as Auto Rentals, Kalloo's and many others.  It is best to reserve a car in advance. However, one can rent a car at the airport upon arrival. The license plates of rental cars are usually designated with an \"R\" (meaning \"Rental\") as the first letter.  Some private individuals will rent cars with plates designated with the letter \"P\" (meaning \"Private\"), but this is an illegal practice and it is better to rent a car with an \"R\" plate.\nHowever, it is becoming common practice for criminals to target drivers of rental cars since many locals seem to believe all foreigners are rich. So more and more car rental firms are now outfitting their cars with \"P\" in hopes that it would disguise the fact that the car is actually a rental.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Road conditions and traffic"]},"\n\n\nBeware of drivers who do not follow the laws of the road. They may not stop at red lights, and make unannounced turns. If you're only accustomed to right-side driving (US\/ Canada\/ Cont. Europe) strongly consider not driving at all.  Drive to stay alive. If you foresee the possibility of unpleasantness, especially one that can turn into a road rage incident, avoid it. \n\nSpeed limits are in effect (80 km\/h on highways), but rarely enforced.  Many road signs are old and not highly visible and distances are marked in kilometers.  It is a fun experience, if you can drive well, to enjoy the roads especially late at night or early morning. Avoid speeding on the main highways in rush hour or around the Queen's Park Savannah at any time. Other than that, chances that you will be pulled over are next to nil.  \n\nAlthough you will see many drivers doing it, it is against the law to make a left turn on Red (equivalent to a right turn on red in Left Hand Drive countries such as the United States).  U-Turns are also illegal.\n\nTaxis and Maxi Taxis in particular have been linked to a lot of crashes and traffic deaths.  They will often stop without warning to pick up or drop off passengers, make risky maneuvers and generally drive recklessly.  While these may illegal, the police don't seem to bother them except for occasional spot checks and road blocks.  Police action involving Maxi Taxis and Taxis usually happens when they cause serious traffic problems, in which case, it is not uncommon for the Police and the town or city to relocate the Maxi Taxis.\n\nPeople will also park their vehicles in the middle of the road where there is no shoulder.  Wait until the opposite lane clears, then go around the parked car.\n\nIn more populated areas, such as the cities of Port of Spain and San Fernando, watch out for pedestrians, as jaywalking is the norm.  Pedestrian crossing traffic signals are few and far between.  Additionally, they require people to push the button in most cases.  Most people don't bother and just wait for traffic to clear, or run across the road.  Be cautious as hitting a pedestrian, jaywalking or not, can land you in more trouble than hitting a car.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Time and distance"]},"\n\nIf planning to go to the other side of the island (Trinidad), get an early start and allow the ",{"type":"'''","value":["entire day"]}," with nothing important scheduled for the late afternoon.

There are twelve flights per day.  Flight time is approximately 25 minutes each way. Caribbean Airlines (http:\/\/www.caribbean-airlines.com) runs the service.\n\nThere are two types of ferry service - fast and conventional. \n\nTravelling by fast ferry costs TT$50 one way and TT$100 return.  Vessels are the T&T Express and The T&T Spirit, which are both owned by the Port Authority of Trinidad and Tobago.  The journey is approximately 2.75 hours. The Express is the faster of the two ships, but the Spirit is newer and has better facilities.  \n\nTravelling by conventional ferry costs TT$37.50 one way and TT$75 return, but the journey is approximately 5.5 hours. Vessels are the MF Panorama and Warrior Spirit.\n\nVehicles can be taken aboard the ferry, but this incurs a different charge which varies by size and weight. A return trip for a private car costs TT$350. This includes the cost of the driver. You are unlikely to be able to take a rental car on the ferry since you need to show vehicle registration documents.\n\nFrom 1 November 2009, only tickets for same day travel can be purchased at the ferry terminals in Port of Spain and Scarborough.

Of course, if someone does suddenly start talking in standard English -- take notice.  They may very well be talking to you!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThe currency on Trinidad and Tobago is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Trinidad and Tobago dollar"]},", also known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["TT"]}," (pronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["teetee"]},"). US dollars are also widely accepted.  Visa and MasterCard credit cards are accepted at many stores.  American Express, Diners' Club, Discover, JCB and others are only accepted in a few places.  ATM (ABM) cards using Cirrus and Plus networks will work in local ATMs and will allow you to make withdrawals in TT dollars converted to your home currency.  The exchange rate when withdrawing from the ATM is slightly better than when exchanging cash.  There are also ATMs in a few places such as shopping malls that will dispense US dollars.  Be advised that Trinidad and Tobago ATMs do not accept PINs longer than four digits.  Consider changing it to four digits before you travel. As of December 2011, Republic Bank ATMs (Blue Machines) accept six-digit PINs.\n\nPrices in shops and stores are generally displayed and do not change according to the customer. Outdoor vendors, however, are another story: they are likely to charge a different, higher price for a foreigner than for a local.  A few will even suggest or demand payment in US dollars. You can try haggling, or just grin and bear it.\n\nMost items except necessities and certain other items that are zero rated attract Value Added Tax (VAT) at the rate of 15%.  The tax is collected at the time of sale.\n\nWeights and measures are officially in Metric, however it is not uncommon for imperial (English) units to still be used.  Though the other units are the same, the imperial gallon is ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," the same as the U.S. gallon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nDue to its varied background, Trinidad and Tobago has excellent and varied food options. In particular, the Indian roots have added to some of the best foods of any country in the world. If you can't tolerate extremely hot and spicy food, be sure to let the cook or waiter know in advance.\n\nPopular throughout T&T are tasty ",{"type":"''","value":["rotis"]},", Indian flatbreads stuffed with Channa(chickpea curry), usually some meat, and other items (including green beans, pumpkin, and mangoes). There are several types of roti available in Trinidad-- sada, which is similar to pita or naan; dhalpouri, which is filled with ground yellow split peas; and buss up shut, a heartier bread, with a silken texture. Cheap breakfasts of sada roti and 'choka' - vegetables of all kinds are available for about TT$3-4. But the most popular fast snack is a 'doubles'. One Famous spot is \"GEORGE DOUBLES\" located in Woodbrook outside the ever famous \"Brooklyn Bar\". Doubles is curried chick peas enclosed in two pieces of fried bread, and servied your choice of condiments. It is a roadside snack, available everywhere at about TT$2-$4.  \"Ali's Doubles\"  is a chain that sells doubles.  There are a few locations around Trinidad, mostly in San Fernando. Eat hot.  \n\nPhoulourie is another popular roadside snack. Phoulourie are small balls, made of fried ground chick peas and flour. It and other popular snack foods like roast corn, cow heel soup, aloo pies (fried potato pies) and saheena (spinach dipped in batter and fried), are often available from street vendors, especially around the Savannah. \n\nTrinidad and Tobago is also famous for its mouth watering callaloo-- a soup made from green leafy vegetables, similar to spinach or kale, sometimes with crab or pigtail added (vegetarians beware!) Callalloo is not the most appetizing of foods to look at, but it is certainly worth a try. \n\nAnother must try in T&T is the famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bake and Shark"]}," or Shark 'n Bake. Most easily obtained along the north coast near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maracas Bay"]]},", pieces of Shark are deep fried, served in cut fried bread called \"fried bake\", and accompanied by various sauces, most popular of which is a puree of shadow beni (a herb similar to cilantro.)\n\nAnother popular food traditionally associated with beach limes is pelau, usually accompanied with coleslaw. Pelau, is not, however, available for purchase at the beach, although you may be able to find it in a creole restaurant.\n\nIf you have a sweet tooth, there are many local sweets and candies to sample like Toolum, Tambran Ball, Guava Cheese, Sugar Cake, Paw Paw Ball, Benna Ball, Jub Jub, Kurma, Barfi, Ladoo, Peera. Many of these will be available on the \"lookout\" on the way to Maracas Beach, and prepackaged in some supermarkets. \n\nA few American style fast food chains are available including KFC, Subway, Pizza Hut and Burger King. There are also a few franchised eat-in restaurants such as TGI Friday's and Ruby Tuesday. There are a few local chains such as Royal Castle (chicken and chips), Chicken Unlimited. These local fried chicken chains have a different taste from American or European fried chicken chains. Pizza Boys and Mario's are two popular local Pizza chains.  The pizza is quite different from American or Italian pizza.\n\nChinese food is available in many places from Chinese takeout stores.  It is Cantonese style but the spices are uniquely Trinidadian.\n\nBarbecued chicken is another popular Trinbagonian dish.  It is similar to American barbecue, but with local spices.  There are roadside barbecue stands that sell a box of barbecued chicken (quarter) with fries, salad and garlic bread.  One popular place is The Barbecue Hut which is an open air tent where patrons will buy barbecue to sit down and eat or take away.  It is on the South Trunk Road in La Romaine, South Trinidad close to the Gulf City mall.  Be aware that it is run by Muslims therefore no alcohol is allowed on the compound.\n\nThe condiments available in Trinbagonian restaurants are ketchup, plain mustard, garlic sauce, shadon-beni sauce (a cilantro-like herb), hot pepper and many more depending on location.  Soy sauce is available in Chinese restaurants, along with an extremely hot Chinese style pepper sauce .  If taking hot pepper as a condiment, be warned!  It is ",{"type":"'''","value":["extremely"]}," hot!  You may see locals putting a lot of pepper on their food, but remember they have been eating it for years so they are accustomed to it.  It is best to try a little and if you feel comfortable add more. If in doubt, avoid it. Salt and black pepper are generally not available as in American restaurants.\n\nLocal bakeries sell pastries such as beef and chicken pies and currant rolls.  They also sell hops bread which are rolls made with white or whole wheat flour.  Hops bread is best eaten hot and can be enjoyed with cheese or butter for a quick snack.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Grocery shopping"]},"\n\nGrocery stores sell a wide variety of packaged goods and produce.  However, for really fresh produce, one can go to the market.  Towns usually have a market day (or days) where sellers, usually local farmers, will bring their produce to sell.  The Government publishes prices for produce, however one may be able to bargain to get a better price.  Again, while weights and measures are officially in Metric, most sellers use imperial units.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Non-alcoholic"]},"\n\nThe most refreshing drink on a hot sunny day is a large glass of a very cold delicious Mauby, a beverage made with the bark of the mauby tree and spices, such as anise and cinnamon.  It is very refreshing and cooling, but may be an acquired taste, since it has a bitter aftertaste.   \n\nCold soft jelly coconut water -- available along the roadsides -- costs about TT$3-4.

It is made from the boiled flowers of the Roselle ",{"type":"''","value":["(hibiscus sabdariffa)"]}," plant.  It is red in colour and best enjoyed cold.  It also has nutritious benefits. \n\nSoft drinks are sweetened with cane sugar, rather than high fructose corn syrup as is the common practice in North America.  This gives soft drinks a different taste, which some argue is better.\n\nMalta is a popular drink, made from malt and hops and available from local bars, restaurants and supermarkets.  It is high calorie and full of b vitamins, and best enjoyed ice cold.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Alcoholic drinks"]},"\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Rum"]},"\n\nBeing a former sugar cane colony, Trinidad and Tobago is famous for its Rum.  Popular brands of Rum are Black Label and Vat 19 by Fernandes and White Oak, Old Oak by Angostura. Some Bars will allow you to buy individual rum drinks either straight with or without a chaser, or mixed.  Some bars will allow you to purchase a whole bottle of Rum, or a \"half\" which is equivalent to half a bottle.  Some bars will sell a \"nip\" which is less than half.  One can also purchase bottles of Rum in stores and at duty free stores at the airport to carry home.  Puncheon Rum is a stronger type of Rum (no less than 75% alcohol).  It is not quite like moonshine but definitely stronger than regular Rum.  In fact it may not be legal to take it back with you.  However it is legal in Trinidad and Tobago and is available from many local bars.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Beer"]},"\n\nBeer is available and quite popular.  The two most popular brands of beer are Carib and Stag, which are brewed locally.  Additionally, some imported beer such as Miller is available.  Other malt liquor drinks are available, brewed locally, such as Smirnoff Ice, and various stouts (Mackeson, Guinness Export etc.). There are no microbreweries in Trinidad, and beer-lovers may find the local beers not to their taste. However, a few bars do import a wider variety of beers. Of particular note is the All Out bar at the Queen's Park Oval cricket ground in Port of Spain (94 Tragarete Road), where you will find a reasonable selection of English ales on draft, sold by the pint.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Wine and other spirits"]},"\n\nWine, vodka, tequila and other spirits are usually imported.  There are no wineries in Trinidad and Tobago, as the tropical climate is not conducive to the growing of grapes. Many restaurants will serve a range of imported wines, however, and wine bars, such as More Vino in Woodbrook have opened in the past few years.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Laws related to alcohol"]},"\n\nNot surprisingly, drinking alcohol in public is not frowned upon in Trinidad and Tobago.  It is \nlegal to drink alcohol in public.  Public drunkenness may get you arrested only if you engage in disorderly conduct. Also the legal drinking age is 18 yrs. However, during election day, sale of alcohol is prohibited and must not be overtly displayed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThere are a wide variety of lodging options. There are major hotels such as Crowne Plaza, Hyatt, and the Hilton. There are also smaller guest houses, particularly in Tobago and beach houses at the coasts (especially the East coast).  Rates vary. On Trinidad, many cities and towns of limited interest to the typical tourist do not have any official accommodations. Staying with locals may be the only option. However, Trinidad has developed a sporting and cultural infrastructure being multi cultural with different religious denominations and can even boast of having world class facilities for swimming, cycling, football, cricket, netball and the arts. For persons or groups of persons willing to experience or connect with similar groups at competitive rates, guest houses such as The Little Inn and the Miracle Healing cater for these niches.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["University of the West Indies"]}," St. Augustine campus "]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["University of the Southern Caribbean"]},".

In order to work, one must obtain a work permit for the job and there must be no suitably qualified nationals to fill the job.  In addition, to pay taxes, one needs to apply for a BIR file number (used like a social security number) and a PAYE number.  One must file tax returns every year if taxes are owed, and pay those taxes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nTrinidad and Tobago has been known for its increasingly high murder rate although this is associated with isolated areas of the country.  The capital Port of Spain, is relatively safe but as with all major cities around the world there are depressed areas which are not safe for tourist. East Port of Spain, areas east of Charlotte Street, become increasingly unsafe and should be avoided as well as Belmont, Morvant and Laventille.  The city is known for is vibrant night life with many restaurants, bars, lounges and clubs.  It is recommended that you travel with companions at night time and avoid wandering into any side streets.  Hotels can provide guidance to assist you.  Tobago on the other hand is relatively safe and more tourist friendly.\n\nIn previous years crime tended to peak in the Carnival (January-March) and around Christmas (October-December) seasons, but recently crime activity was year round, but this has now drastically decreased due to the new change in government. But it is still best to exercise some caution at night time, while in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nFor extended stays, register yourself at your country's nearest diplomatic mission.

Private doctors are also available on an appointment basis.\n\nPublic Ambulance services are available to everyone by dialing 990.  This service is operated by the fire department. However these may prove to be unreliable since ambulances are limited and fire stations are often far away.   Private ambulance services are available.

Being a former British colony, these discussions usually centre around football(soccer) and cricket. \n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, many of the world's great religions are well represented.  Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Bah'ai are popular.  Judaism is not very popular and is practised mostly among expatriates.  Atheism and agnosticism are not widespread although many people will hold agnostic beliefs without being openly agnostic.  \n\nAlthough Trinidad has a large Indian Hindu community, there are no taboos that Westerners would have a difficult time getting used to. The cow is not so sacred as to prohibit eating beef or wearing leather although Hindus do not eat beef. (A few ultra-conservative Hindus may take exception to all this, but they are very, very few in number.)\n\nTrinidadians can be extremely friendly and hospitable -- especially with guests who share a common religion with them. Be sure to bring small gifts to show your appreciation, as some visitors who had no intention of visiting or staying with locals end up doing so anyway. \n\nSome homes (including a few guest houses) in rural areas are not connected to any underground water mains. However, they may still have running water from a large, round, black outdoor water tank.  If staying in such a place, be sure to conserve water -- especially in the dry season (or year-round if it doesn't collect rainwater from the roof). If the tanks run dry, water trucks for refills may be available.  However, even underground piped water may be rationed during the dry season.
