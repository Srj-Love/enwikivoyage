Business visitors or others with the right 'connections' may be able to arrange a visa on arrival.  The cost is 100 Dinar, but the process can be slow.  This must be paid in Libyan Dinar.  If you do not have Dinar, you will have to go to the area after baggage reclaim to exchange some money (minus your passport).  The security staff will allow you back in, but make sure they see you leave to be sure.\n\nLeaving Libya requires the right stamps in your passport.

It was previously operated by the Civil Aviation and Meteorology Bureau of Libya, it is currently operating under an ad-hoc management.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of armed conflict and closure of the airport in mid 2011 many well-known international carriers were flying to the Libyan capital such as British Airways, Lufthansa, KLM, Emirates and Alitalia.\n\nScheduled civil airline services were suspended when NATO enforced a No Fly Zone (NFZ) over Libyan airspace in 2011. Prior to this international and domestic flights were departing the airport from the main International passenger terminal. The terminal capacity was previously 3 million passengers a year. Two new terminals are to be built within the next few years bringing the total capacity of the airport to 20 million passenger movements. The first new terminal was due to open by March 2011 however the airport now requires extensive reconstruction. The radar system was seriously damaged in a NATO air strike in late August 2011. Fighting at the airport destroyed several commercial airliners and the airport infrastructure was damaged.\n\nThe airport currently features one main terminal building, which acts as both the international and national terminal for the airport.\nThe existing dual use terminal is a five-floor building with an area of 33,000²m. Check-in facilities are situated in the ground floor. Departure and duty-free shops are located on the first floor. A lounge and prayer room where previously also available in the terminal, as well as a restaurant located on the fourth floor.\n\nThe Tripoli International Airport airport was officially re-opened for civil aircraft operations on 11 October 2011.\n\nSeveral airlines are now providing flights from the Tripoli International Airport to international destinations.
