As in neighbouring states, ethnic and communal strife has claimed many lives over the past years. The current ethnic setup in Tripura is a consequence of the Partition of India, when large groups of Bengali Hindus left the area that became East Pakistan (today Bangladesh). The previous majority population, the tribals, became a minority and socio-economically disadvantaged in comparison to the new majority.\n\nTwo major tribal rebel groups operate in the state, the National Liberation Front of Tripura and the All Tripura Tiger Force, which wants Tripura to secede from India. There have been no known account of any violence against tourists in the state, nor any indication that tourist would be a target of violent groups. On the other hand, there are only a few foreign tourists reaching the state at all.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe main language in the state is Bengali. The largest language of the tribal population (approx 30% of the population of the state) is Kok Borok. Other languages include Manipuri, Chakma, etc..

There is a direct bus service ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kolkata"]]},"-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dhaka"]]},"-Agartala.\n\nFor Bangladeshi visas, there is a Bangladeshi consulate in Agartala which runs a same day visa service; however (depending on the mood of the visa officer) the price of a tourist visa to Bangladesh may mysteriously rise and the length of your stay in Bangladesh also depends on this factor. Make sure you have a good idea of what you want to see in Bangladesh as this will usually enable you to be granted a longer stay.\n\nAgartala is connected by air from Kolkata, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guwahati"]]}," and Silchar. The airport code is ",{"type":"'''","value":["IXA"]},". Foreign citizens need to register at the airport on arrival.\n\nAgartala is recently connected directly by air from Delhi, Indira Gandhi Airport.\n\nRecently, train services have been introduced in the capital and an express train runs daily between Agartala and Lumding, which enhances travelling in this princely state. As there is heavy rush, tickets should be booked well in advance.\n\nDaily Train service is also available from Agartala to Silchar and Lumding (Assam) and Dharmanagar (Tripura).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBuses, run by CNG and disel are the main transport between towns of the state. At Agartala, City Buses are available in a regular interval. A small group can hire an Autorickshaw, run by CNG, for getting around the city. If time is more of an issue than money, one can hire a vehicle with driver. Do note that road conditions might be bad in rainy seasons, even by Indian standards. On some legs, vehicles travel in military convoys, moving extremely slowly through the countryside, especially on National highway, which connects Agartala with Assam. Some rural areas are not safe to travel by nighttime.\n\nThe fastest way to travel internally in Tripura is an helicopter service that connects Agartala with the northern parts of the state.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Ujjanta Palace, Agartala (Main City)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Neermahal Palace, Melagarh (Approx 50 km)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Maata Bari temple, Udaipur (Approx 60 km)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Bhubaneswari Temple, Udaipur (Approx 60 km)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Unakoti, Kailasahar (Approx 150 km)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Jampui Hills, North Tripura (Approx 200 km)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Pilak, South Tripura (Approx 100 km)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Kamalasagar, Kashba (Approx 40 km)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Maharaja Bir Bikram College, Agartala (Main City)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Malanchya Nivas, Agartala (Main City)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Temple of Fourteen Gods, Old Agartala (Approx 15 km)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Akhaura Border, Agartala (Main City)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Rose Valley Park, Agartala (Outskirt of the city)"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"<","value":["center",["A Weekend Itinerary for visiting Tripura"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Day1 (Sunday): "]},"\n\n7.00  am: Arrival at Agartala airport\n\n            (Regular flights available: Air India, Indigo, Jet Airways, Jetlite)\n\n8.00  am: Check in any hotel.
