Just outside the center of town, there are several sets of locks. A first set of small locks from 1800, which are now derelict. A second set of locks from around 1844. A third set of locks from 1916, which are still in use today. About 10 freight ships per day pass the locks today, and throughout the summer months about 4000 pleasure boats pass by.\n\nNot far from the locks, is the Olide hydropower station. The waterfall of the mighty Göta river was tamed with the construction of a huge powerplant between 1905 and 1914. The power station is built with huge granite blocks and looks like an enormous castle. On some days in the summer months the waterfall is (partly) released again.\n\nTrollhättan has been important to Swedish industry, with the SAAB Automobile factory. Nearby, the SAAB museum is located.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Fyrstads Flygplats"]}," doesn't connect to many places other than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stockholm"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe train station (",{"type":"''","value":["Resecentrum"]},") lies just ten minutes walk from the center of the town.
