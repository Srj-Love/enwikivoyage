We hear about Tromsø for the first time in 1252, when the first church was built here. The next 550 years, Tromsø was a minor religious centre, as people in a vast area regularly congregated in Tromsø to go to the only church in the area. Trade and industry, however, suffered under the domination of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergen"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trondheim"]]}," to the south. \nTo promote trade in Northern Norway, the 80 heads' strong settlement was issued its city charter in 1794. Initially hindered by the Napoleonic wars, the city soon developed into a small trade centre with connections from Arkhangelsk to Central Europe, and from 1820 onwards, Arctic trapping was a major industry. Early visitors, who probably didn't expect people in Tromsø to eat with a knife and fork, dubbed the city the \"Paris of the North\" in complete surprise that French was spoken, fashions were more or less up to date and people knew what was happening down below the Arctic Circle.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Expeditions"]},"\nA number of expeditions made Tromsø their starting point in the first decades of the 20th c. Explorers like Roald Amundsen and Fridtjof Nansen frequently recruited sailors in Tromsø.

This low island is 10 km long, and contains both built-up areas and birch forests, as well as the airport. The city centre is located in the south-eastern part of the island. This is where you find Polaria, the Polar Museum, The Art Museum of Northern Norway, the Contemporary Art Gallery as well as most of the shopping, good eating and nightlife.

Recent construction has also blocked off the Midnight Sun from most of the main street.\n\nIn winter, the sun is below the horizon between November 26 and January 15.
