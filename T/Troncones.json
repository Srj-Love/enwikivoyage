Negotiate with a Taxi before you get in, but a Taxi will usually charge about USD$70 from the airport.  Alternatively, there are frequent buses that head north on the highway from Zihuatanejo. If you board one of these, ask the driver to drop you off at the turn off to Troncones, and then take a colectivo to the township.  This is a much cheaper option.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMost things are within walking distance in Troncones, but 'colectivos' run up and down the beach from Troncones to Majagua, and from Troncones to the highway for 5 pesos per passenger.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nEnjoy all kinds of activities on the town's three mile stretch of nearly empty beach. Spend the day splashing around, boogie boarding and\/or body surfing. Take long walks, runs, or horseback rides on the playa. Or just relax in the hammock, read, and recharge your batteries. \n\nSnorkeling directly off Troncones Point is some of the best in the area. A public access to this area is located directly in front of Troncones Point Surf Club and Hostel (see \"Sleep\" below). You can learn to surf on Troncones beach and\/or tackle one of the many nearby surf breaks, including Saladita, a.k.a. “The Wave Machine” (a great spot for beginners and long boarders). Local ecotour companies provide additional entertainment and exercise. Surfboards, stand up paddle boards, bikes and ATV's can all be rented in town. For the more contemplative, Troncones offers daily yoga, meditation, and chi gong classes—all with a stunning ocean view. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Present Moment Retreat"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Head North at the T, PMR is 500 meters on the beach side of the road."],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=8am - 10pm daily"],["price="],["content=Gorgeous setting, amazing food.
