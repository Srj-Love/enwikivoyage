It is a key city in Norway, it's skyline dominated by the lovely cathedral and city life dominated by the university. Downtown Trondheim is beautifully located inside a large river bend where the river meet the wide Trondheimsfjord.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology; its more than 25,000 students are a lot in a city with merely 160,000 inhabitants in total, and this contributes greatly to the city's economy.\n\nTrondheim is the oldest of Norway's major cities, and its old heritage can still be traced in and around the city centre. The marvellous Nidaros Cathedral, the second largest church of Northern Europe and the only real gothic cathedral in Norway, towers over the city centre. The Nidaros cathedral is regarded as a national treasure and has been the site of coronation of Norway's kings. The cathedral has been under restoration since 1860 and as the only church in Norway obtains grants directly from the parliament through the state budget. The city centre is roughly the area inside the meandering Nidelva. The Cathedral is the only one in Norway with the full range of gotic elements on display. Supposedly built over the grave of St Olav, Norway's patron saint and \"eternal king\". Trondheim sits on the shores of the Trondheimsfjord, the 3rd longest in Norway, and so wide that it is almost like a small ocean. \n\nThe city boasts a rich, cultural heritage, but is still a major centre. Even if the size is modest, there's a lot going on in Trondheim. Music, arts, culture, alternative politics, nightlife, student life... all combines into making Trondheim one of the most exciting city centres of Northern Europe.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe city celebrated its 1000th anniversary in 1997 but, contrary to popular belief, Trondheim was not so much of a center for the Vikings, as it was founded at the end of the Viking Age. However, it was the religious center of northern Europe during the Middle Ages and a vital hub for North Atlantic trade, giving it plenty of characteristic mansions and harbor houses. From 1152 until the protestant reformation Trondheim (or ",{"type":"''","value":["Nidaros"]}," as it was called) was the seat of the archbishop of Norway (present day Norway plus Iceland, Orkney and Shetland). The ancient name Nidaros reads \"mouth of river Nid\". For centuries, Trondheim was the northernmost mercantile city in Europe, giving it a special \"edge-of-the-world\" feeling. This also resulted in a more outgoing international culture than many other Scandinavian cities at the time. The inhabitants like to call their city the historical, religious, and technological capital of Norway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.avinor.no\/Norsk\/Lufthavner\/Trondheim_lufthavn,_Varnes\/ Trondheim Airport Værnes"]}]}," serves international and national flights.

You can only get drinks of strength 4,7% or less from regular shops.  So, only beer.  Also, they stop selling beer at 8PM sharp on weekdays, 6PM sharp on Saturdays and they don't sell it at all on Sundays... a legacy from Christian Democracy.
