[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Troy-banner.jpg"],["pgname=Troy"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Troy"]}," is a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Michigan"]]}," and a suburb of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Detroit"]]},".\n\nTroy was first settled in the early 19th century and was named after Troy, New York where the first settlers previously resided. The city was incorporated out of Troy Township into the City of Troy in 1955. Much of the development in the city occurred between the 1960's and 1990's. There are several large corporations headquartered in Troy including Delphi, ArvinMeritor, Flagstar Bancorp, Budd Company, and Kelly Services. It was formerly the world headquarters of Kmart before it was purchased by Sears Holdings and its large headquarters complex still stands at the northwest corner of Big Beaver & Coolidge.\n\nIn 2008, Troy was ranked 22nd on a list of \"Best Places to Live\" in the United States by CNN Money, using criteria including housing, quality of education, economic strength, and recreational opportunities. In 2008, Troy ranked as the fourth most affordable U.S. city with a median household income of US$90,000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["42.574"],["-83.15"],["zoom=12"],["height=400"],["width=400"],["layer=OP"],["staticmap="],["align=right"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nTroy is located along Interstate 75 a major highway and is approximately 20 miles northwest of downtown Detroit.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amtrak"]]}," station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (Michigan)"],["Birmingham"]]}," is located along the border with Troy.

Shuttle service to Troy is available but is expensive (roughly $30 per person) and a taxi to Troy could run as much as $60. Therefore, it may be less expensive to arrange someone to meet you at the airport, or rent a car; even if you don't intend on driving much once you are in Troy.\n\nFor those who seek a bargan, (or if you live relatively close to the area) try flying into Flint Bishop International Airport. Fares are somewhat lower than what you would expect at Metro Airport, and the drive time into Troy is about the same (about 1 hour).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nPublic bus service is provided by SMART.

Every destination you would want to go to should have ample parking.
