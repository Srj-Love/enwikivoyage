Anyone from outside of Cornwall will have visions of a built-up centre with a large conurbation and a good public transport system: don't. Truro is a practical city once you're in, and residents of other Cornish Towns will often visit to shop with more variety. But, unless you're staying within walking distance of the centre, expect to either drive in or have to plan a journey. There is a very small 'inner-city' area surrounding the centre. Even the most immediate 'suburbs' are small villages that have nothing but a few miles of field and a winding road separating them from the centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nTrains from London Paddington - Plymouth - Truro.\n\nTruro is at the junction of the A39 and A390 arterial roads, some 14 miles north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Falmouth (Cornwall)"],["Falmouth"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Truro Cathedral"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.trurocathedral.org.uk\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Only completed in 1910"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Royal Cornwall Museum"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.royalcornwallmuseum.org.uk\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +44 1872 272205"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=River Street, open Mo-Sa 10am-5pm, last admission 4.30pm, free admission - includes the Courtney Library and exhibitions devoted to the history, culture and geography of Cornwall"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Victoria Gardens"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.truro.gov.uk\/parks-and-gardens\/victoria-gardens.aspx"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Have High Tea at Charlotte's"]}," - In a Victorian building on the main shopping square in Truro, Charlotte's, on the second floor, is a step back in time.
