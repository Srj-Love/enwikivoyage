It is famous for its textile and crafts industry and typical National Revival architecture, featuring 140 cultural monuments, museums and expositions. Tryavna is the birthplace of Bulgarian writer Pencho Slaveykov and revolutionary Angel Kanchev.\n\nThe location has been inhabited since Thracian times, or for thousands of years, but the earliest definitive proof of the existence of the modern village dates to the 12th century, in the years around the conquest of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom by the Ottoman Turks. During the period of Bulgarian National Revival, when Bulgarian society redefined itself in the 18th and 19th centuries during the Ottoman occupation, the town became heavily involved in the development of crafts. Houses from this period feature their own architectural design. The ground floors had irregular forms and housed craftsmen and traders. The upper floors featured wooden bow-windows, the roofs were covered with well arranged rocks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe city has a continental climate, owing to its position close to the Balkan Mountains and distance from the Black Sea. Tryavna has hot summers and cold, snowy winters — which is good for the popular sky resorts in the nearby Uzana area. This part of Bulgaria has all four seasons, although spring is brief and falls mainly in April. The average high daily temperature in summer is about 27°C and in winter about 4°C.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Trqvna.jpg"],["thumb"],["The old clock tower in Tryavna."]]},"\nThe town is well connected with the whole country thanks to its excellent road network and railway station.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Car"]},"\nThe town is located on Route 609 and Route 552, which are the same road when they pass through Tryavna.
