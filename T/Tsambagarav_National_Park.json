Both mountains and several others are permanently snow-capped. Below the peaks are many glaciers and glacial lakes. These glaciers have left deep rocky gorges that have many waterfalls including one 7 m (23 ft) one on the north side of the park. During summer, the valleys north of the mountain are very green and full of wildlife, livestock, and flowers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and Fauna"]},"\nThe endangered species; Argali sheep, Ibex, Snow Leopard, Rock Ptarmigan and Altai Snowcock all inhabit the park. Though not all can easily be found, especially the snow leopard. The Altai subspecies of the Argali sheep that is found in the park is the largest wild sheep in the world. The rams of an adult male can weigh over 35 kg (75 lbs).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Culture"]},"\nA small village of Uriankhai and Kazakhs live near the park during the summer months to support Uriankhai and Kazakh nomadic herders living inside the park.

Hiking and horseback or camel riding are the best ways to get across the park. While the most popular activity is staying with one of the nomadic Kazakh or Uriankhai families that live inside the park during the summer months when everything becomes green. A visit to one of the families inside the park will take you back to a lifestyles that haven't changed much in over 1000 years. Some of the Kazakhs eagle hunt and can show you their eagles, though there is only hunting during the winter. If you go with a guide, they can show you petroglyphs and Turkic standing stones. Also, you can go fishing or bird watching if you are there at the right time.\n\nClimb Tsambagarav Mountain and the smaller Tsast Mountain inside the park. Both will require ropes and crampons, though smaller peaks in the park can be hiked.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cultural Experiences"]},"\nNo trip to Mongolia would be complete without at least a meal inside a ger with a real-life nomadic family. The hospitality and tradition of even an unannounced visit will be surprising to most westerns. Though the food variety is limited and not particularly health as it consists mostly of mutton, flour, and oil, the ceremony of cooking and eating large servings of simple cuisine of the steppe is a truly unique experience. Everything is washed down with hot milky tea. The Kazakhs and Uriankhai inside the park have different customs and cooking styles that will become obvious with close observation. After eating, watch the family tend to their animals and go about their daily routine, or even lend a hand. It is recommended to bring a small gift of useful supplies in exchange for hosting you. Many families living inside the park host multiple foreigners throughout the summer and are being very generous in feeding random tourists. So, don't be offended if they ask for 5,000 or 10,000T for a meal and a place to sleep.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Summer Activities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Trekking"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Fishing"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Archery Lessons"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Mountain Climbing"]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Winter Activities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Eagle Hunting"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Skiing"]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tours"]},"\nThere is not a lot of infrastructure in Mongolia in general, and Bayan-Ölgii especially.

The largest companies offer unguided tour options to the main National Parks with only transportation and supplies, but no guide, cook, or other services.

Take pains to make sure they are reputable and do have what you need. Ask the park information office about good camping areas in the park.\n\nThe same rules for camping apply here as anywhere else in the world. If you pack it in, pack it out! This is especially important in and around mountain, where serious high alpine climbing can be had. It is a very fragile area and easily impacted by human use.\n\nAs for camping toilet needs. There are no toilets. If you don't know how to \"shit in the woods\", you'll want to practice a bit before undertaking a Mongolian adventure. Also, there most likely won't be any woods.
