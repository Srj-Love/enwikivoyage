This vantage positioning of the lodge has made it a stop over for many safari adventures, nature lovers and holiday makers who are assured of sampling Kenya's wildlife attractions that continuously beat a track to the three water holes sunk by the lodge below the cliff.\n\nDuring the dry season the waterholes are the convergence of a lot of wild animals moving almost in a trance as if urged on by some kind of telepathic communication, the sight is just fantastic. The location evokes a romantic inspiration that once moved a visiting British poet who now incorporated his experience at the lodge in most of his poems, to describe it as sample of wonder that is better than a dream.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southern Rift Valley"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Tsavo East National Park"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-2.7786111111111"],["38.771666666667"]]}]
