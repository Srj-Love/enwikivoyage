While the monastery was closed in the 1930s by the communist government, the original temple was turned into a museum. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =  -8.1"],["febhigh = -6.4"],["marhigh =   0.2"],["aprhigh =   8.1"],["mayhigh =  16.0"],["junhigh =   20.1"],["julhigh =   20.5"],["aughigh =   19.3"],["sephigh =   15.1"],["octhigh =   8.0"],["novhigh =   -1.0"],["dechigh =   -6.5"],["janlow =   -20.4"],["feblow =   -19.3"],["marlow =  -13.0"],["aprlow =   -4.5"],["maylow =  1.7"],["junlow =   6.5"],["jullow =   8.7"],["auglow =  6.8"],["seplow =  1.5"],["octlow =   -5.2"],["novlow =   -13.1"],["declow =   -18.2"],["janprecip =  1.9"],["febprecip =  2.7"],["marprecip =  5.8"],["aprprecip =  16.3"],["mayprecip =  32.6"],["junprecip =  63.6"],["julprecip =  75.4"],["augprecip =  66.9"],["sepprecip =  26.7"],["octprecip =  13.4"],["novprecip =  5.8"],["decprecip =  2.6"],["description = NOAA (1961-1990)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nDue to improved roads to the capital, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulaanbaatar"]]},", there is no longer scheduled air transportation.
