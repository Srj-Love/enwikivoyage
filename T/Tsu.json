The vowel is similar to the one in the English word 'too', but is shorter, has less lip rounding, and is typically voiceless; it is perceptible, but sounds 'whispered'. Also, as English speakers may find the [t] hard to hear, the name sounds rather like 'Sue'. Pronouncing the [t], however, is essential in conveying the meaning.\n\nIn Japanese, the city name is usually written either using the character 津, or with つ, a 'hiragana' symbol which indicates the syllable [tsɯ]. Tsu is the only Japanese city name which consists of a single kana, making it the shortest name for a place of any size in Japan.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chubu Airport"]]}," is connected to Tsu by a ferry service which takes 40 minutes.

Its main station (津駅 ",{"type":"''","value":["Tsu Eki"]},") serves both Kintetsu and Japan Rail (JR) trains. A basic ticket between Nagoya and Tsu costs ¥980 on the Kintetsu line. In the north there is the smaller Kintetsu Edobashi (江戸橋駅 ",{"type":"''","value":["Edobashi Eki"]},") station, which is where most students get off for the university, while the south is served by Kintetsu Tsu-Shinmachi (津新町駅 ",{"type":"''","value":["Tsushinmachi Eki"]},"). Travellers can alight at any of the three stations for the same fare. JR also have separate local stations around the city. 'Limited express' trains call only at Tsu, and a supplementary charge is imposed.\n\nTsu is also on a direct line to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osaka"]]},"; for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyoto"]]}," travellers should take the Kintetsu line and change at Yamato-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yagi"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTsu is split from north to south by Route 23, a highway which runs down the west coast of Ise Bay from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nagoya"]]},". It is therefore fairly easy to orientate yourself relative to the road. Tsu railway station is just off Route 23 towards the centre of town, as is Edobashi station.\n\nBuses run from outside Tsu station all over the city. Routes are written in Romanised Japanese on the front. Stops are signposted only in Japanese. At Tsu Station, passengers alight at one stop and board at another. The stop opposite the local police station and branch of McDonald's by Tsu Station serves several buses which head along Route 23 in the direction of Mie University (三重大学 ",{"type":"''","value":["Mie Daigaku"]},") and the University Hospital (大学病院 ",{"type":"''","value":["Daigaku Byouin"]},").\n\nBoard a bus via the centre door and take a ticket; you should look up its number on the board at the front of the bus to find the fare you should pay.

The bar is also the venue for a community restaurant at lunch time serving an 850yen set lunch, cooked by local amateur chefs on a rotating schedule.

Being located next to the station and bus stops, as well as above the city and prefectural tourist offices, make this a very convenient option.
