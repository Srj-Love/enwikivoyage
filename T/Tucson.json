Although with half a million residents it is smaller than the capital city, its cultural life is just as vibrant.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nTucson has always been a crossroads. Until recently, water was relatively plentiful in Tucson, in spite of its location in the middle of a desert. This made it an important travel route, an agricultural center, and a communications nexus.\n\nTucson's history is ancient, with evidence of human occupation stretching back 10,000 years. Between A.D. 200 and 1450, the Hohokam culture dominated the area -- the Pima and Tohono O'Odham peoples that still occupy the area are descendants of the Hohokam. In 1699, Father Eusebio Kino, S.J., established the Mission San Xavier del Bac, southwest of present-day Tucson. Over the next 100 years, other missions were established in the area, but European presence was minimal.\n\nIt wasn't until 1775 that the Presidio of Tucson was created by Don Hugo O'Connor. At that time, it was the northernmost Spanish outpost in the New World.  In 1821, Tucson became part of the new country of Mexico, and in 1853 it became part of the United States as a result of the Gadsden Purchase. In 1863, Arizona became a US territory, and by 1880, its population was around 8,000. In 1912, Arizona became the 48th state to enter the union.\n\nToday, Tucson is still a crossroads, with European, Native American, Mexican, and Asian cultures bumping into one another, in sometimes conflicting and sometimes compatible – but always interesting – ways.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visitor Information"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Metropolitan Tucson Convention & Visitors Bureau"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.visittucson.org\/"],["email="],["address=100 S Church Ave"],["lat=32.220846"],["long=-110.9727"],["directions=downtown"],["phone="],["tollfree=+1-800-638-8350"],["fax="],["hours=M-F 9AM-5PM, S-Su 9AM-4PM"],["price="],["content=Offers a free Official Destination Guide, Golf Guide or Dining Guide."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["32.22167"],["-110.92583"],["zoom=11"],["height="],["width="]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tucson International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TUS"]]},"), ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name="],["url=http:\/\/www.flytucson.com\/"],["email="],["address=7250 S Tucson Blvd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 520-573-8100"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Served by a number of airlines.
