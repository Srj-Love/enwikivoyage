As a result, Tulsa breaks the Oklahoma stereotype of being nothing but a flat, arid dust bowl. Summers can be very warm and with the cold wind across the plains it can get very cold in the winter, but it does not last long. The winters are considered to be very mild. There is not much snow, just a few inches each year, typically, although in 2007 and again in 2008 there were rather large \"ice storms\". Tulsa has over 225 days of sunshine annually.\n\nIn Tulsa you will find old west charm as well as a cosmopolitan atmosphere. You will find the people of Tulsa love their city and they have that southern charm, so they are willing to help you find your way around. Tulsa has one of the largest concentrations of Art Deco in the nation, having been a booming city during the 1920s when the architecture was first built by rich oil barons who built stately mansions and turned the Downtown area into a treasure trove of art.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Tulsa International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TUL"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tulsaairports.com\/"]}," in the northern part of Tulsa.

Almost all major intersections are one mile from each other, and exactly in a straight line. That makes it much easier to find places than in cities where streets go every which way. The major exception is downtown, which is slanted at almost a 45 degree angle to the rest of the grid.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\nSeveral freeways and bypasses can be used to easily get around the Tulsa Metro area: I-244, I-44, US 169 (Mingo Valley Expressway, aka \"Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway\"), US 75, Hwy 51 (Broken Arrow Expressway, The \"B.A.\"), Creek Turnpike.\n\nThe streets and avenues are planned on a 1 mile by 1 mile grid system, with the main arterials running on each mile.  In the core of the city, named avenues run north\/south and are named after US cities, generally in repeating alphabetical order (for example, Winston-Yale-Allegheny-Braden).  In the mid-town area the names are taken from colleges and college towns. North\/South is divided by Admiral Blvd.  Name streets East of Main are cities east of the Mississippi River, vice versa for name streets west of Main.  In the parts of the city farther from downtown, north-south streets are numbered.  It is important to recognize that the specific format of the north-south numbered street names is ",{"type":"'''","value":["North\/South 145th East\/West Avenue"]},".\n\nNumbered streets run East\/West with Main Street and the Arkansas River as the dividing line.  Watch out for Place, Street, Avenue designation, e.g. 47th Place, 47th Street, or Florence Place, Florence Avenue.  It is important to recognize that the specific format of the east-west numbered street names is ",{"type":"'''","value":["West\/East 71st Street North\/South"]},".  In some parts of the city, ",{"type":"''","value":["numbered streets intersect,"]}," so the distinction is important.  Although rare, one east-west numbered street may even intersect with a street of the same number running north-south.\n\nDowntown streets were originally platted parallel to the Frisco railroad tracks.  When Tulsa expanded beyond the bounds of its original plat, the expanded areas were platted in alignment with the points of the compass. Thus the \"twisted\" area down-town represents the original extent of Tulsa ca 1907.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By bus "]},"\nTulsa Transit ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tulsatransit.org\/"]}," provides bus service for the Tulsa Metro area.

The central station is at 319 S. Denver (downtown). They do not run that often, especially to the outer towns like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Broken Arrow"]]},". Unlike major cities in the Northeast, the city bus is not a major form of transportation in the city. It is usually a means of travel for those who are without their own motor vehicle.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bicycles"]},"\nTulsa has an extensive interconnected paved bike trail system.  Rivertrail follows the Arkansas River from downtown Tulsa south to the suburbs.  The Katy Trail runs west to Sand Springs.  The Osage Trail is a rails-to-trails route that begins at the OSU-Tulsa campus and travels north 15 miles to Skiatook.  The Creek Trail connects Rivertrail and continues east through Broken Arrow to the NSU-Broken Arrow campus.  Riders accustomed to flat terrain may find Tulsa's rolling land to be a bit more challenging, particularly during the heat of summer.  If you are looking for a good workout, the Creek Turnpike Trail follows the land's original contours.  Rivertrail is probably be best choice for the rider seeking an easy route.\n\nFour bike loan depots, located along Rivertrail, allow riders to borrow a bike for free for up to twenty-four hours. \n\nTulsa has an active bicycling community.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Downtown Tulsa.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Downtown Tulsa"]]}," \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Creek Council Oak Tree"],["url="],["email="],["address=18th St. and Cheyenne Ave."],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=It was under the Creek Council Oak Tree in 1836 that the Lochapoka Creek Indians kindled a ceremonial fire using live coals they had carried from their Alabama homeland.
