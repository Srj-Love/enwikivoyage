The tropical beach backdrop is the main attraction of this picturesque, much-visited small ruin on the shore of the Caribbean Sea. Shortly after your arrival, you will understand why early Mayans picked this beautiful place to relax.\n\nBe prepared for LOTS of people and tour groups at the archaeological site. To avoid the crowds, it is best to stay overnight and visit the ruins early in the morning before the buses arrive, or later in the afternoon.  Morning is recommended since you can catch spectacular vistas when the sun is rising over the Caribbean.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Mayan ruins at Tulum Mexico.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["400px"],["Tulum"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" From Cancun International Airport "]},"\nYou can catch an ADO bus to Tulum directly three times a day: 2:10PM, 7:45PM and 8:45PM. Ticket prices are about $15 USD. The ride will take about 2 hours.\n\nYou can also take the ADO bus to Playa del Carmen with departures nearly every hour for about $12 USD. Once in Playa del Carmen you transfer to a second bus to Tulum for an additional $5 USD.\n\nRental cars are priced reasonably and are the easiest way to get around the Tulum area. Shop around rates upon arrival, and feel free to haggle. Check with your credit card company to see if they automatically insure you, most do so you don't have to pay the additional insurance that the rental agency often tries to insist you purchase. It is a very easy drive to Tulum. To get there you take the only highway south from Cancun Airport straight down past Playa del Carmen, Akumal, etc. About 90 minutes from the airport you will arrive in Tulum.\n\nThere are several companies offering Private, and shuttle services:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.discoverymundo.com\/transportation ",{"type":"'''","value":["Discovery Mundo"]}]}," Private transportation to any hotel in Tulum at excellent rates.

Mayab bus stops more frequently en route to Tulum from Playa Del Carmen.\n\nTo visit the ruins, get off the bus at the first Tulum stop at the intersection with the access road to the ruins. It's an easy one mile or so flat walk to the ruins from the intersection.\n\nAn alternative to the buses is to catch a \"collectivo\" van.

As soon as you park, a man on a bicycle should find you and charge you for parking (50 pesos). You must go through a sort of half open-air mall (which is empty before 8AM).  From there you can either sign up with a tour guide (US$20 per person?), pay for a shuttle ride to the ruins (20 pesos), or walk a mile along a road to the ruins. The guides are reported to be better story tellers than actual experts on Mayan culture.  The walk is on level ground and passes quickly as you admire the jungle and abandoned shops along the way.  If you can walk it, do it and save a few bucks!  As you approach a stone wall, to the left will be a brown wooden building where you can purchase your ticket into the ruins (51 pesos, an additional 35 pesos if they see that you have a video camera).

There are also a number of affordable beach front cabana-type lodging locations.  Walk the beach and simply step in and inquire about accommodations and rates.  You will be surprised and delighted.\n\nIt should be noted most of these establishments are Eco-friendly and do not provide electricity past midnight. Toilet paper can not be flushed and it is asked that water and other resources be used sparingly. The hotels in Tulum aim to keep Tulum as it is and stop the ecological problems that have already taken hold in Cancun and Playa Del Carmen.\n\nIf you are staying on the beach and trying to save money, it is wise to stock up on food and drinks in the pueblo. There are not too many restaurant options on the beach, and the ones that are operational are comparatively quite expensive.\n\nTaxis have a near monopoly on transport to and from the playa.

After visiting other ruins in the area such as Coba, Chichen Itza and Ek Balam, Tulum's main claim is the sea-side setting.  It is best visited on a clear, bright day or at sunrise. Bring your swimming suit.  At the time of writing, one of the best sections was closed to visitors and covered with plastic bottles and other refuse.\n\nA standard to telephoto zoom lens does well if you must photograph during times of peak tourism.
