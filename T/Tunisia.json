Plan accordingly.\n\nTunisia has a rich cultural history, ever since Antiquity.  The Carthaginian Empire, Rome's arch enemy, was centered in Tunisia. Its capital, Carthage, is now a suburb of Tunis.  Founded by Phoenician settlers from Tyre and Sidon (modern day Lebanon), Carthage was an ancient Mediterranean powerhouse.  Three wars between Rome and Carthage (known as the Punic wars) were waged in the first few centuries before the birth of Christ.  These culminated with the decimation of Carthage in 146 B.C. by the Roman general Scipio, who is said to have wept at its destruction.  \n\nBetween the destruction of Ancient Carthage and the Arabic conquests of the 7th century, many cultures have made Tunisia their home.  Carthage enjoyed a new period of prosperity under the Roman Empire until its collapse in the 5th century.  Roman rule was replaced briefly by the Vandals, who made Carthage the capital of their kingdom.  Carthage was then absorbed temporarily by the Byzantine Empire, until the rise of Islam in the 7th century.\n\nAfter the dissipation of the Arabic Caliphates, the Ottoman Empire's Turkish Pashas ruled Tunisia.  With the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Tunisia eventually fell under the sway of European Imperialism, as a French Protectorate, along with neighboring Algeria.    \n\nFollowing independence from France 20 March 1956, President Habib Bourguiba established a strict one-party state. He dominated the country for 31 years, repressing Islamic fundamentalism and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. Bourghiba was quietly replaced in 1987 by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Zine El Abidine Ben Ali"]},". His forced abdication was carried out under the pretext that he was unfit to carry out his duties as president, due to his ailing mental and physical state as a result of extreme old age. Nonetheless Bourghiba is still credited with the birth of the modern state of Tunisia, for which he fought his entire life. Ben Ali took a moderate, non-aligned stance in its foreign relations. Domestically, it has sought to defuse rising pressure for a more open political society.\n\nHowever, this all changed in late 2010. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mohamed Bouazizi"]},", a street vendor set himself on fire in protest of the confiscation of his wares and police harassment. This became the catalyst for the Tunisian Revolution as well as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Arab Spring"]},". After massive street protests Ben Ali was forced out of power in January 2011.

Tunisian highways speed limit is 110 km\/h.  It is possible to maintain that speed on that road very easily.  The routes shown on some maps have a planned extension to Gabes then Ras Jedir (Libya Frontiers) in the South as of 2011-2014 and to  Ghardimaou (Algerian Frontiers) in the West, but several years later.  The remaining Highways have single carriageways, with traffic round-abouts at major intersections, which follow the European model (those in the roundabout have the right of way). Consequently, on roads other than the A-1,2,3 it can be difficult to maintain an average speed of more than 75 km\/h most of the time as the speed limit is 90 km\/h.  Almost all road signs are in both Arabic and French.   \n\nLike most developing countries, road accidents are the leading cause of death and injury in Tunisia. Tunisians are aggressive, poorly skilled and discourteous drivers. They are unpredictable in their driving habits, jumping traffic lights, seldom signaling when changing lanes, often ignoring traffic lights and stop signs, driving at very high rates of speed regardless of the quality of the roads or condition of their vehicles, and stopping at almost any location even though it may block other cars or potentially cause an accident. Because of the lack of sidewalks, pedestrians walk on the roads often without regard for cars or their own safety. Sadly, Tunisians seldom secure their children in appropriate car seats and these tiny passengers often bear the brunt of most accidents.\n\nAlthough police are visible at many major intersections, they seldom enforce traffic rules or stop bad drivers unless its to solicit bribes. \n\nPeople unfamiliar with driving in developing countries are best to use public transportation or hire a driver.\n\nDriving in Tunis is further compounded by narrow streets and limited parking spots. To see the Medina of Tunis, it would be best to park some distance from the Medina, and take the light rail (called TGM) in from Marsa\/Carthage, the green tramway (called Metro) downtown, or perhaps a taxi in from the nearer outskirts. \n\nRental Cars are fairly easy to find, but somewhat expensive, at 100 dinars or so a day, for a medium sized car such as a four door Renault Clio.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nPrivate taxis are reasonably priced even for long-distance travel, just be sure to agree on the fare before you set off.

Example fares from Tunis to Sousse are 12\/10\/6 dinars (6\/5\/3 Euros) in Grand\/1st\/2nd class. Although tickets are issued with wagon\/seat numbers marked on it, that is largely ignored by locals. So if you are travelling with more people, try to get onboard quickly to find adjacent seats.\n\nA good thing to do is to buy a carte bleue (blue card). It costs around 20 dinars for a week and you can travel all around the country using the banlieue (short distance train) and grande ligne (long distance). For the long distance you will have to make a reservation and pay a small fee (1,50 dinars or so). These passes can also be bought to cover 10 or 14 days. There are rarely queues at the booking office and a little bit of French goes a long way. Trains go also to Tozeur and Gabes in the south where it is easy to access the Sahara and Ksour regions respectively. In some stations where the frequency of trains is small (e.g. Tozeur), the ticket booth will remain closed for most of the day and reopen around the time of the departure of the next train.\n\nA light railway (Called TGM) also connects Tunis northward to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carthage"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marsa"]]},". Take this light railway system to Sidi Bou Said as well. One-way light railway tickets will cost approximately 675 millimes (1 Dinar = 1,000 millimes).\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Louage in Tunisia.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["350px"],["Louages (shared taxis) are ubiquitous in Tunisia"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By louage"]},"\n\nLocals use ",{"type":"''","value":["louage"]}," or long-haul shared taxis where there is no train or bus.

Be aware that while louages are very cheap, they can also be stifling hot during the summer months and tourists may be hassled. \nFurthermore, louages have the reputation to drive at a fast pace, and to be less safe than other transportation, so be aware of that.\nLouage departures are very frequent, a louage departs as soon as the seats are filled. \nAll Louage cars are of white color, with a side stripe showing the coverage area.\nLouages between major cities are recognizable by their red stripe, louages within region are recognizable by their blue stripe and Louages serving rural areas are recognizable by their Yellow strips (the Rural Louage can be Yellow with blue stripes, or a van fully painted in brown color).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nLong distance bus (called ",{"type":"''","value":["car"]},")",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sntri.com.tn\/"]}," is also a safe and economic way to travel between major cities such as Tunis, Nabeul, Hammamet, etc. You will generally find a station in each major city offering many departures per day (every 30 minutes between Tunis and Hammamet).

However, all Tunisians learn standard Arabic in school, so most locals will be able to communicate in standard Arabic if needed. Almost all locals are bilingual in Arabic and French. French is the primary language of higher education, and is commonly used in administration, commerce, and the media. English is of limited use, but fine for use around tourist areas.

The Dinar is divided into 1000 Millemes, with typical coins being 5 Dinars (Silver with copper insert), 1 Dinar (large silver color), 500 Millemes (1\/2 Dinar: smaller silver color), 100 and 50 Millemes, (large brass), 20 and 10 Millemes (smaller brass) and 5 Millemes (small aluminum). It is prohibited to bring dinars in and out of Tunisia, so you have to change your money locally.\n\nPrices are typically marked in dinars and millemes, with a decimal point like: 5.600 or 24.000 or 0.360 sometimes with TND as a label like TND85.500. Markets typically sell items by the kilogram. So tomatoes may have a sign \"480\" on them which means 480 millemes per kilo. Good cheese will be marked something like 12.400 or about $10 a kilo.

In the 2005 summer session, there were over 500 students of all ages from throughout the world. This included students from the USA, France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria, Norway, Croatia, Turkey, Japan, China, etc.\n\nOn the first day of class, there is a placement exam. The levels range from absolute beginner to advanced, with 15 to 25 students per class. Only Arabic is allowed in the classroom. Both used are a course book developed by Bourguiba Institute and also music videos in Arabic with the accompanying text.\n\nThe courses are daily from 8:00AM to 1:15 PM. In the afternoon there are activities and tours of the medina and museums. They also offer optional weekend excursions to sites in Tunisia. At the end of the one-month course there is both a written and oral exam.\n\nSeveral students complained about the lack of cleanliness in the student dorms. Some students stayed in a hotel and then rented a beach-side apartment for the month. It's usually easier to negotiate rental prices once you are in Tunis. \n\nSome students also expressed concern with the school's methodology, which appears to be antiquated and in need of great revision. If you have studied Arabic before, whether in your home country or in another school in the region, be prepared for a substandard continuation of your Arabic studies. \n\nThe school is in the city of Tunis. It's about a 20 minute metro ride to the beach. If you go to the summer school, be prepared for the hot temperatures.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\nWork issues are quite sensitive in Tunisia as job offers are limited even for Tunisian nationals.\n\nAn estimated 15% of the population is unemployed and many more survive on meager jobs. And as more and more of the new generation earn degrees predominantly in business, computer science, and engineering, those industries are getting saturated as well. For a foreigner, functional knowledge of Arabic and\/or French will aid you well, and your likeliest bet for finding a job will be somewhere who has needs for your national language too. While pick-up restaurant and handyman jobs are common in other countries, these positions are much less likely to present themselves in Tunisia because of local competition. Safest is to arrange for a job before arrival. For a high level job, lots of experience and excellent skills are of course required. Low level jobs are mainly in the service sector as in much of the world.  Salaries in Tunisia are naturally lower than those in Western Europe or North America, due to the lower cost of living.\n\nForeign investors are welcome to establish projects and the government is providing facilities related authorizations for such initiatives.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nTunisia recently underwent a revolution and is currently in a contentious transitional period. While large-scale violence is not currently occurring, demonstrations do still happen from time to time, and are sometimes violent or\/and broken up brutally. So consult your foreign office to check on current conditions before traveling to Tunisia, and do your best to steer clear of any large demonstrations that may occur while you are there.\n\nIt is apparently not considered rude for a man to stare at a woman's body which should indicate that modesty will attract less attention.  Women can expect to be the target of frequent catcalls (\"Gazelle\" seems to be especially popular). If you travel as part of a couple, stay together as much as possible as the female traveller should not wander around on her own if she doesn't want to be pestered. The pestering usually amounts to nothing more than bizarre words and the occasional touch but it can be extremely persistent and annoying.\n\nTunisian women often wear outfits that would normally be seen on the streets of any major world city (tight jeans, slinky top), but they do so while showing traditional modesty by exposing virtually no skin. Arms are covered down to the wrists, collars go to the neck (cleavage is non-existent) and a head scarf may be worn. Western women visiting can minimize attention by selecting clothing that minimizes skin shown. V-necks are fine if another layer with a higher collar is worn underneath.\n\nTravellers report problems being pestered either to buy something or for other purposes. Persistence is a major complaint. Some say that a refusal often results in a bad reaction, \"being hissed at\" is one example, but those who have been advised to refuse politely with a smile rarely complain. \"Non, Merci\" is a very good response, with a smile. This seems to be borne out by the reports of sole female travellers who you would expect to receive the most attention, but who often report the least problems (from an admittedly small sample), perhaps because they are more cautious than accompanied females. It certainly seems to be the case that sole female sea bathers attract a good deal of unwelcome attention (even molestation) until a male friend arrives.\n\nTheft of belongings, even from hotel rooms and room safes, is widely reported and the usual caveats apply - keep valuables in a secure place (e.g. supervised hotel safe deposit), do not flash too much cash, and keep wallets, purses and other desirable items where pick pockets cannot reach them. A good recommendation is only to carry enough cash for your immediate requirements and only one credit or bank card, provided you can be assured of the security of your reserves. Besides, most of the Automatic Bank-notes distributors are available and foreign credit cards are accepted. You can take cash (in equivalent Tunisian Dinar) directly from your bank account with a small extra fee (Bank transaction from €1 to €2 ).\n\nTheft is also reported in the Airport. Keep your belongings under your direct supervision all the time.\n\nBe aware that the export of Tunisian currency is forbidden and searches of wallets and purses can, and do, occur at Tunis airport.  If you are found with more than about  20 - 30 Dinars, you will be invited to return landside to change them.  The problem is that this \"invitation\" will come after you have already been through passport control and handed in your exit card;  therefore it is not practical.  You will then be invited to hand some or all of your Tunisian money (which in any case cannot be spent in the duty free shops) to the uniformed official.  Arguing will get you nowhere and a request for a receipt will be met with an outright refusal.  Judging from the way the money is swiftly palmed, you will have almost certainly just paid a bribe.\n\nWhen it's time to settle the bill in a Tunisian cafe or restaurant, it's advisable to ensure that you are presented with an actual paper, itemised copy of a bill before handing over any money. Frequently, your waiter will claim to have calculated your total amount due in their heads and this will always be more than you actually owe. Also, check prices on menus before ordering. Some establishments will claim to have no menus, they usually have wall mounted menus. Tunisian workers are extremely low paid (£300 per month approx) and will frequently try and take advantage of tourists without their wits around them.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Malaria"]}," - There is NOT much of a malaria risk in Tunisia, but pack your bug spray."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Sun"]}," Please remember that the sun is frequently your biggest enemy, we would recommend frequent application of a high (factor 30 or better) sun screen.

For three days at the end of July, 2012, the vast majority of shops were closed during the day, although the Tunis medina was mostly open. Virtually all of the restaurants were closed. Beyond a few tourists drinking coke, not a single person was eating or drinking during the day, even at the touristy cafes at Sidi Bou Said. It was not clear if any of the tourist restaurants were even serving.\n\nIn Tunis, on the Ave Habib Bourgiba, all of the cafes had their tables put away until after iftar (the breaking of the fast) at sunset, around 19:30. After that many people were out, and you could order food at some cafes, and coffee and desserts at others. Just before the iftar, Ave Habib Bourgiba is completely devoid of life and other-wordly. At smaller cafes, like 3 Etoiles on Rue Mustapha M'Barek, you can see families and men sitting around tables full of food, waiting for sunset.\n\nBe prepared for a somewhat unique experience if you choose visit Tunisia during ramadan. During the daylight hours, eat and drink (even water), very discretely. Buy bread and foccaccia from the street vendors in the evening for lunch the next day, or find one of the local shops that is still open to buy something to tide you over. Virtually no one drinks alcohol, and your best bet (at least in Tunis) might be the Hotel Africa.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Telephone"]},"\nPublic telephones are available in all towns and cities and in most villages under either the name of ",{"type":"''","value":["Publitel"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Taxiphone"]}," - in cities simply look around - there is at least one on every street.
