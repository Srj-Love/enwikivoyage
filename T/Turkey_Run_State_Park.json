The region of and around the park is known for its population of wild turkeys, and many believe the park got its name when the turkeys would head to the canyons during the winter to shield themselves from the cold, then pioneer hunters would use the canyons as funnels, and chase the turkeys for an easy catch. The area was also used for a mill and coal mining for a time.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nTurkey Run is most famous for its beautiful sandstone cliffs and canyons.
