His intent was to march an army up this dry riverbed and conquer the Khanate of Khiva. The expedition failed, and the Russians abandoned the settlement for over 150 years.\n\nIn 1869, the Russians made a second and latest attempt. They named their fort ",{"type":"''","value":["Krasnovodsk (Красноводск)"]},", which is the Russian version of the original name, Kyzyl-Su (Red Water). Krasnovodsk was Imperial Russia's base of operations against Khiva and Bukhara, and the nomadic Turkmen tribes. It fell to the Red Army in February, 1920.\n\nIn 1993 Krasnovodsk was renamed \"Turkmenbashi\" Many would assume that the city was renamed on behalf of Niyazov's self-proclaimed title \"Turkmenbashi\" meaning \"The leader of Turkmens\" yet the rationale behind renaming is to denote that Turkmenbashi is the place from where Turkmens spring.
