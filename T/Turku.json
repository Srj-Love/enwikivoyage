It was settled during the 13th century, making it one of the only few – and by far the largest – medieval cities in Finland. Turku is the cradle of Finnish culture, since over the years it has played an important role as the gateway to Finland for international influence.\n\nBisecting Turku city centre, the river Aura is the heart and soul of the city: this is where Turku was born and a large part of city life – museums, sights, restaurants and cafés – still concentrates around the banks of the river. The river banks, together with the island of Ruissalo with its oak forests and 19th century villas, form a national urban park allowing for a pleasant stroll from, say, the national shrine of Finland, the Turku Cathedral, to the Turku Castle, which used to house Swedish Kings. Turku is at its best during the summertime, when it hosts a great number of festivals, including rock festivals, chamber music festivals and a medieval fair.\n\nIn addition to the cultural sights and museums Turku region attracts visitors due to the surrounding ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Archipelago Sea"]]},", which stretches all the way from Turku to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Åland"]]}," and on to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stockholm"]]},", forming the largest archipelago in the world by the number of islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Turun tuomiokirkko.jpg"],["thumb"],["Turku Cathedral"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nTurku is Finland’s oldest city and one of the oldest in the entire Nordic region. The city came into existence at Koroinen on the banks of river Aura, a few kilometres north from the Turku market square. Trading took place on this historic site as early as in the 1150s, and in 1229, the bishopric was transferred there as well. Aura River Valley had already been a prosperous and relatively densely populated area since the Iron Age. Turku was named Åbo by Swedish settlers because it was a bo (settlement) on the Aura River (å). The Finnish name, Turku, is an archaic Russian word for 'marketplace' – the city's market has long been one of the largest and finest on the south coast.\n\nThe year 1229 is also regarded as the year in which the City of Turku was founded. In recent years, excavations in different parts of the city centre have provided more light on the city's history. The construction of Turku Castle began in the 1280s, the Dominican monastery of St. Olof was being built on Samppalinna Hill and Turku Cathedral was consecrated in the year 1300. From this point on, the city held an important position in the Swedish-Finnish state and it had staple town charter (the right to conduct foreign trade), assuring that trading was brisk. The German bourgeoisie of Turku held a major role in the early development of the city, and Turku had a community that was part of the Hanseatic League which dominated trade along the coast of Northern Europe.\n\nDuring Swedish rule, Turku was the largest and most important city of its region as well as being a major city of the Swedish Kingdom. Queen Christina of Sweden founded the first university of Finland in Turku in 1640. At that point it was only Sweden's third university following ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uppsala"]]}," University and the Academia Gustaviana in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tartu"]]},". Turku remained the Finnish capital until the year 1812. Russia, after overtaking Finland from Sweden 1809, moved the capital to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Helsinki"]]},", which was closer to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]}," and farther from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]},". Turku still remained Finland's largest city until the end of the 1840s, but its ambitions were dealt a death blow in 1827, when a raging fire destroyed most of the city. \"Turun palo\" is still the largest urban fire in the history of Finland and the Nordic countries. As a result the city was almost completely destroyed, and the rest of the major institutions with the exception of the archbishop's seat were moved to Helsinki. The burnt city needed an altogether new town plan, which was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel the following year.\n\nIn 2011 Turku was the European Capital of Culture along with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tallinn"]]},", the capital of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Estonia"]]},". Afterwards Turku has seen a huge boost in both domestic and foreign visitors\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\n\nTurku remains a regional capital of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finland Proper"]]}," and it's the third most populous city-region in Finland and the eighth largest urban area in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nordic countries"]]},", with around 330 000 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region. Nowadays Turku is a major academic town in Finland: there are two universities, a technical college, two business universities, a law school, and a medical school. Consequently, you will find that the city is bustling with young adults. The great number of students means that restaurants, live music clubs and nightlife are ample. A true local specialty you will find in no other Finnish city are the floating bars in the river Aura. There is a cultural spirit in the city, and some of the proud residents are still irked that Helsinki took over as Finland's capital back in 1812. In other parts of Finland people from Turku are stereotypically thought of as being bit reserved and uppish in their views of their hometown. However, if you have a coffee at the main Market Square and chat with the locals, you'll soon find out that this isn't the case. Turku dialect has many influences from Swedish, and it can from time to time sound even a bit like Estonian. The city is also famous throughout Finland for its processed mustard called Turun Sinappi, though ownership and production was controversially moved abroad.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Literature"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Turku Castle.jpg"],["thumb"],["Turku Castle"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Literature"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Vares"]}," (book series) (Reijo Mäki, 1986–13).

Persons in wheelchair and the person assisting travel for free, as does a person with an infant in a baby carriage.\n\nIf you intend to take the bus more than twice a day (read: in more than two two-hours periods), it becomes economical to ask the bus driver for a 24 hour ticket, priced €7.50. The equivalent, for the same price, can be bought by sending an SMS of \"LIPPU24\" to 169003 (not by prepaid SIM:s, as it is invoiced later).

You can recognize a free taxi in dark, since the taxi sign on the top will have its light on. Hailing taxis on the street is rare, however, and may not even work; calling the central dispatch is the common method.

Advance bookings less than 30 min before desired departure time are not accepted — in that case, just phone the dispatch when you are ready to go. Outside the worst rush hours, a taxi should take no more than 5 minutes to arrive. If you are out late at night, plan ahead. During weekend bar closing hours, wait times in excess of an hour are not unheard of.\n\nA normal taxi will carry 4 people and a moderate amount of luggage.

Quick 1–2 mile trips will cost in the €8–13 vicinity. All taxis accept major international credit cards. Generally you can trust taxis with both prices and the route taken.

It's generally smart to leave about ten minutes before the last call, to avoid being caught in the rush of everybody trying to leave at once, especially if you are planning to get back to your night spot by a taxi.\n\nNight clubs tend to have guarded cloakrooms where you can leave any of your outer garments in exchange for a ticket. Using the coat service is generally considered mandatory even if this is not explicitly pointed out. The cloakroom fee is usually 2 - 2,50 euros. Do not lose the ticket; the bar staff will often not want to hash out ticket confusions during closing time when things are at their most chaotic. If you lose the ticket, you may be told to come back the following day to get your things, expect to be able to prove the jacket is your by telling the staff the make of the jacket\/colour of lining\/contents of pockets.\n\nThe legal drinking age in Finland is 18 for mild alcoholic drinks (up to 20%\/40-proof) and 20 for stronger drinks than that, but virtually all establishments sell stronger drinks to 18-year-olds as well. The minimum age required to enter bars\/pubs\/nightclubs differs; legally, one must be at least 18 to enter places that serve alcohol, but many clubs and bars have higher age limits (20 - 24 yrs).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cafes"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Qwenselska gården, norra delen 2010.jpg"],["thumb"],["Courtyard of the Pharmacy Museum."]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=CaféArt"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.cafeart.fi\/"],["email="],["address=Läntinen Rantakatu 5"],["lat=60.44951"],["long=22.27102"],["directions="],["phone=+358-40-158-3383"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Weekdays 10AM-7PM, Sat 10AM-5PM, Sun 11AM-5PM"],["price="],["content=Coffee culture in Finland is quite big, but Finns tend to prefer \"regular\" filtered coffee over espressos and similar coffee machine products.

The emergency medical services helpline advises you on the help you require.\n\nFor non-emergency medical care, the City of Turku’s Welfare Division provides medical advice over the phone at +358 2 10023. Lines are open weekdays from 8AM to 3PM. The hearing-impaired have their own service for the evaluation of medical care, counselling and making an appointment at a health centre.
