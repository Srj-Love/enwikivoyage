Tuvans comprise the largest ethnic group (over 60%) in the region and Tibetan Buddhism, mixed with indigenous Shamanism, is the predominant religion. Perhaps Tuva's greatest offering for the visitor is its musical treasure: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Khoomei"]},". Khoomei, also known as throat-singing or overtone-singing, is a method in which the singer simultaneously produces a low drone and a series of higher melodies over the drone note. This music is utterly unique and a performance is said to be a powerful experience. Tuva is of interest for its diverse and impressive wild landscapes. Tuva's topography spans desert, grassy steppe, lakes, and snow-covered mountains, many of which are dotted with cultural monuments of the Tuvan and Schithian herdsman who have nomadized across the region for millennia. \n\nTuvan's suffered greatly under Soviet repression of their culture and religion, particularly at the incidents of 1929, in which shamans and Buddhist monks were ruthlessly arrested and killed in a large-scale act of cultural vandalism against the Tuvan minority. As a result, foreign tourists are likely to be greeted with an even warmer welcome than in most of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Siberia"]]},", as they are seen as part of a new future for Tuva that values the region's traditions. Many of the Tuvans were forced by the Soviet government to abandon their nomadic lifestyle and to work on collective farms, but to this day Tuvan culture remains essentially rural and, to a lesser degree, nomadic. Accordingly, to experience the \"real\" Tuva, you will need to get out into the countryside, among the sacred peaks of the Western Sayan.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nTuvan is, along with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian phrasebook"],["Russian"]]},", the official language of the region and is widely and usually spoken by ethnic Tuvans.

The new railroad is now under construction, which is scheduled to finish by 2012. The best option is to take the train from Moscow to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abakan"]]}," (76 hours), with one-way fares varying from approximately 4,000 Rub (US$160) to 9,500 Rub (US$390). The price changes according to peak tourist seasons in Russia: by far the cheapest day to travel is the 1st of January, while July is the most expensive. \n\nIt is possible to take a bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abakan"]]}," in neighboring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khakassia"]]},". While a night bus is an option, don't take it! The route meanders through the gorgeous ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sayan"]]}," mountain landscapes of the Ergaki region, which would be foolish to miss. The train from Moscow arrives in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abakan"]]}," at 6 AM, and apart from the bus, there will be plenty of taxi drivers offering to take you to Kyzyl (approximately 420 km from Abakan) for 1,000 — 1,500 Rub (US$40–60). There is a possibility that you may have to register at the Russian-Tuvan border — just hand over your passport to the police officer, there is no fee for the service. \n\nKyzyl Airport is small and offers flights to and from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Siberia"]]},"n center of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Krasnoyarsk"]]}," as well as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Raduzhny"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khantia-Mansia"]]}," because of the number of people who work in the oil industry there. The direct flights from Moscow to Kyzyl have been resumed as of Fall 2007, the flight goes twice a week via Ufa, Bashkiria's capital, departing from Moscow on Sunday and Wednesday.\n\nFor some more tips on getting to Tuva, see here: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.couchsurfing.org\/group_read.html?gid=19199&post=9776097"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tuvans.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["A traditional way of getting around"]]},"\nThere are busses to the regional centres from the central bus station in Kyzyl. Nearby is a piece of waste land on a corner where cars and minibusses wait to fill up before departing to anywhere you want. If not a popular destination, it can take a while. It is of course possible to pay enough to take the car without filling it up, although less fun and less likely to provide you with local knowledge and even hospitality at your destination. This could also be important in making sure you can also get a ride back to Kyzyl!

It will be killed humanely in the traditional way, as Ghengis Khan decreed: no blood must touch the Mongols' earth. The animal is calmly turned so that a small incision can be made with a very sharp knife. Immediately a careful hand is inserted, finds the heart and cuts off the blood circulation.\n\nAbsolutely all the edible parts are then prepared and cooked, to be presented in separate heaps on a large flat dish. The guest is then asked to cut a piece of each kind for each person, using the sharp knife against a wishbone-shaped 'anvil' made from the breastbone.

A clear, derived broth is served to be sipped from the bowl.\n\nA very traditional food, 'dalgan', can be hard to find nowadays unless you fall in love with a rural Tyvan grandmother. It is like Tibetan 'tsampa', rolled oats toasted to taste on hot sand in a pot over the fire, sieved to separate, and pounded to a coarse meal.
