The Metro is a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Urban rail"],["light rail"]]}," system, which mostly runs on the surface, with a couple of miles of underground tracks in Newcastle and a small section in Sunderland. The first metro services ran in 1980, and the network has been progressively extended since.\n\nThere are two lines: the Green Line runs from Newcastle Airport to South Hylton (in Sunderland) and the Yellow Line runs from St James Park to South Shields via a lengthy loop via the coastal towns of North Shields, Whitley Bay and Tynemouth. Note that the east-west and north-south sections of the Yellow Line cross at Monument Station, so if, for example, you are travelling from St James Park to South Shields, it is much quicker to transfer to the southbound Yellow Line at Monument rather than riding along the entire route. The Green Line shares tracks with the Yellow Line for the majority of the section through central Newcastle and Gateshead.\n\nServices run approximately every 6–10 minutes between 6:00 and 23:00. Single tickets range from £1.40 to £3.60 depending on the distance travelled, return fares and day passes are also available. Ticket machines accept coins and credit\/debit cards. Although there are only ticket barriers at major stations and hopping (riding without paying) is widespread, it is advisable to keep your ticket handy as trains and stations are patrolled by ticket inspectors.\n\nSmoking is banned on the entire system, including open-air stations. However, this rule is often overlooked and it's not uncommon to see people smoking on the trains, particularly late at night, despite the CCTV surveillance cameras.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nTyne and Wear has a fairly comprehensive bus network, with several different operators.
