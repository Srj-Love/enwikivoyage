It is particularly noteworthy for its stunning and clean beaches (unlike those at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sidon"]]},") as well as some of the finest examples of Roman architecture in the world. Situated on a peninsula, it is the largest city in the south of the country after Sidon.\n\nTyre is the base of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":WikiPedia:UNIFIL"]]}," headquarters which operates in the south of the country, and monitors the border region between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lebanon"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Israel"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":WikiPedia:Occupied Territories"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Syria"]]},". Don't be surprised to see UN troops out and about in this town, which is generally very safe for visitors.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThe cheapest way of getting into Tyre is by private bus. Large, air-conditioned buses go from Cola Junction, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beirut"]]},", throughout the day for approximately $4 and take about 2.5hrs.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By minibus"]},"\nPrivately run minibuses also go frequesntly throughout the day and late into the evening from Cola Junction, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beirut"]]}," and from the bus station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sidon"]]},". They take a variety of routes and will often stop and start throughout the journey to let passengers on and off.\n\nMinibuses that go via the coastal roads are must slower (Beirut to Tyre can take 3-4hrs), but some minibuses will take the motorway route (2.5hrs from Beirut, about 1hr from Sidon). Prices are usually 2-3,000 Lebanese Lira (approximately $1.50-2) from Beirut.\n\nDo check when you get on board how much the price is as tourists will often be charged more than locals. If you're not sure how much the fare should be, try speaking to someone on the bus - many people speak English and you will very likely find someone to help you out.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Private Taxi"]},"\nThere are two ways to get to Tyre via taxi - the first is a simple ",{"type":"'''","value":["private hire"]}," ($20-30 from Beirut), or the ",{"type":"'''","value":[" 'service' "]}," option where you can share with other people who are travelling in a similar direction ($10 would be reasonable from Beirut to Tyre). The journey will take approximately 2.5hrs from Beirut, depending on any stops that have to be made.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Checkpoint information"]},"\nA number of military checkpoints operate on the roads between Beirut, Sidon and Tyre. There are also occasionally other checkpoints which are run by Hezbollah soldiers. If you bus or taxi is asked to stop, make sure you have your passport to hand, and take off any sunglasses or hats to ensure proper identification. Generally you will be waved through without any further problems. Do not be alarmed if you are asked why you are travelling.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nWithout a doubt the best way to get around Tyre is on foot. The beachfront and main roads are all within 5-10mins walk from each other. The Al Bass Archaeological site is slightly further away and a taxi may be the easiest option to get there.\n\nTaxis are pretty cheap and some are even comfortable to travel in. Some are the registered yellow taxis that operate throughout the country, but many are private cars, often in varying states of repaire (from virtually new to over 40 years old in some cases). A rough rule of thumb is that a short ride in a 'service' - or shared taxi - will cost approximately 2,000LL (around $1.50), with longer journeys costing up to 5,000LL (around $3.50). Always check the price before entering the taxi, and check whether it is a taxi (and therefore private and more expensive) or a service (which will stop to pick up other passengers on the way, and is much cheaper).\n\nTraffic is typical Lebanese - if you want to go, you must go regardless of the 'western' way of thinking in the traffic. This means that drivers frequently won't give way unless they absolutely have to, and lanes and road signage are frequently ignored. Of course, do ask your driver to slow down if you don't feel safe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nAlthough frequently eclipsed by the grandeur of Beirut and the bustling souq of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sidon"]]},", Tyre is a beautiful and enjoyable city in its own right.

During the summer months (May-September) there are a large number of beach cafes which operate from the huts. Prices can be expensive, but it is a perfect spot for sunbathing and enjoying the impressive waves. During the summer, the sea is warm enough to swim in at night, making it a special place. Moreover you can't rent a fishing boat (FLOkA) and take a tour around the seaside of Tyre or you can navigate to the rocky islands (ZEERRE) where you can find amazing spots for diving. Also renting a jetski got be fun, you can find dealers everywhere around the see.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Christian district"]}," at the Western tip of the peninsula is a higgledy-piggledy area with thin roads and lovely hidden shops.

The beach and the pool is exclusively only to the hotel's guests although others can use them too by paying a small fee - this fee is mostly to keep 'unwanted people' off the premises. At the beach you can order drinks, narghile, rent a sun chair or perhaps attend a diving course.\n\nAl fanar has been renovated recently and is also a good place to stay in.\n\nThe Artizan Hotel, on Rue Senegal, is a second floor bed and breakfast and is popular with locals and visitors alike.

A number of touts operate in this area and will try to get you on their minibus before you go on another. Be assertive with them - ask their destination and the price in advance. Keep a hold of your luggage - a common trick is for them to grab your luggage and stow it on the minibus before you get a chance to complain. However, don't worry too much - the negotiation is all part of the fun.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Lebanon"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["33.270833"],["35.196111"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Tyre, Lebanon"]]}]
