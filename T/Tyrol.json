Full of romantic lakes and castles and beer drinking lederhosen clad locals playing ump-papa music and marching in bands, the place can seem a bit fairy tale to the visitor at times because it is! Innsbruck and Bolzano\/Bozen are the only real \"bigger\" cities making it a natural paradise too. The roads get clogged with tourists however in the summer and winter months. South Tyrol sits on the sunny side of the Alps and is an interesting mix of three cultures making a special place in Europe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nAs in nearly all of Austria, Austro-Bavarian is the main everyday spoken language of Tyrol (except in Reutte district where it is Alemannic). The Tyrolean dialect is even often tricky to understand for residents of eastern Austria (including Vienna) let alone from northern Germany. But, as in all of Austria, standard (Austrian) German is the official language used in all official publications and schools, so the vast majority speaks it, and in Innsbruck basically everyone is fluent. English is spoken by most educated middle aged and young people, and Italian is also quite prevalent due to the proximity of the South Tyrolian border and a small immigrant community in Innsbruck.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nThere is an international airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Innsbruck"]]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["INN"]]},") which has schedules to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vienna"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Frankfurt"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Graz"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nice"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hannover"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stavanger"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alghero"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gothenburg"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Olbia"]]},".
