But if you choose to stay at one of the hotels on the way to Martil (Champs or Dreams) petite taxis and grand taxis are always available.  \n\nPetite taxis are very cheap, though the fare increases if you have luggage. \n\nThough there is a decent-sized public bus system, they are notorious for running late and being filthy.\n\nTo get to nearby beaches, like Martil, Cabo Negro, Ricon, Marina Smir, and Kabila, grand taxis are easily found at a bottom of Rue Moulay Abbas (the road running along the park, beautiful views of the Rif Mountains).  The fare for a single passenger to Martil is 5 dirham, but if you want a little more room you should purchase two seats.  For less popular destinations, like Marina Smir, or for a more direct route to beaches like Cabo Negro and Kabila which require two different grand taxi rides, some travelers choose to bargain with the driver to purchase the whole taxi.  This is often more expensive, but well worth it considering the time saved and the increased comfort.  Drivers are often very happy to arrange to pick up passengers after their day at the beach, saving travelers time as well as hassle.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nTetouan enjoys a typical Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild winters.
