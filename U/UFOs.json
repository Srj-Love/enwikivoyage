[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Little A'lee'inn banner.jpg"]]},"\nA ",{"type":"'''","value":["UFO"]}," is an unidentified flying object.  UFOs have been sighted throughout history and around the world (as well as in outer space by astronauts). While the vast majority of UFO sightings are explainable (identified flying objects, IFOs), a small number remain truly unidentified and unexplainable from known phenomena and craft. Some of these may be experimental military craft, though others are bizarre enough to seemingly rule out that potential explanation. Additionally, there are many accounts of individuals being abducted into craft. We take no view of such accounts here, but merely direct interested travelers to places identified as being especially associated with UFOs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["UFO hotspots"]},"\n\nA UFO hotspot is a location where an unusually high number of UFOs have been sighted.\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wycliffe Well"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Brazil"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barra do Garças"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mato Grosso do Sul"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alto Paraíso de Goiás"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Goiás"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Area 51"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Groom Lake"]]},", Nevada"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Claimed UFO crash sites"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["United States of America"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kecksburg"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pennsylvania"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Roswell (New Mexico)"],["Roswell"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Mexico"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other places of ufological interest"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Peru"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Nazca"]]}," - It is alleged that the Nazca lines may have been created for or by extraterrestrials."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["United States of America"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Wright-Patterson Air Force Base"]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dayton"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ohio"]]}," - One of the locations where the Roswell UFO wreckage may have been sent."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Area 51"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Groom Lake"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nevada"]]}," - One of the locations where the Roswell UFO wreckage may have been sent.
