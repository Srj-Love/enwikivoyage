They applied for King Taksin's protection, duly granted in 1779 along with the city's new name, meaning \"Royal City of the Lotus\". Modern-day Ubon was a U.S. air base during the Vietnam War and grew rapidly at the time, but little has happened since then. The town of Warin Chamrap, on the south bank of the river, is effectively a suburb of Ubon these days.\n\nThe sleepy Ubon office of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tourist Authority of Thailand"]}," (264\/1 Khuan Thani Rd) is worth a visit to pick up useful English maps of the town and nearby provinces.

Thai Airways has two daily non-stop flights between Bangkok (BKK) and Ubon and return. Nok Air has three daily non-stop flights between Bangkok Don Mueang Airport (DMK) and Ubon and return. Air Asia has two daily non-stop flights between Bangkok (DMK) and Ubon and return year-round. Air Asia operates 3 weekly flights between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phuket"]]}," and Ubon from Oct-Mar and between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chiang Mai"]]}," and Ubon from Nov- Mar. Flight time is 50 minutes in an Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 aircraft.\n\nThe airport is at the northern edge of the city almost within walking distance, but accommodation is scattered around Ubon, so better not to consider walking. Much better to go to one of the two limousine (taxi) counters in the airport arrivals hall and purchase for only 100 baht a taxi coupon that will take you to almost any point in the city. Limousine (taxi) rates in Ubon are extremely cheap by Western standards and lower than those in Bangkok. Set prices have been established to most destinations in and around Ubon. A taxi from Ubon to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chong Mek"]]}," costs 1,000 baht for the 90 km one way trip and a taxi from Ubon to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mukdahan"]]}," costs 2,000-2,500 baht (depending on the vehicle type) to travel a one-way distance of 192 km. The driver does not charge for the return trip as in some Western countries. There are no taxi meters and the fare must normally be purchased from one of the two taxi counters at the airport arrivals desk. \n\nIf you prefer not to take a fixed price taxi, you can always walk the 200 m beyond the general airport parking area to haggle with the waiting tuk-tuk drivers, but chances are that your trip will end up costing you more.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By bus "]},"\nBuses to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]}," take 10 hours (due to stops) and arrive near Mo Chit BTS station.

A regular bus service now operates direct from Ubon bus station (near the \"Big C\" shopping complex) to Pakse in Laos, and caters for travellers who wish to obtain a Lao visa on arrival (it waits for all passengers to complete immigration and visa formalities before continuing to Pakse).

The station is to the south of the city on the opposite side of the Mun River in Warin Chamrap. Buses 2 and 6 connect to the centre.\n\nOne option is to catch the overnight night express train from Ubon (Warin Chamrap station) to Bangkok. Train departs at 18:30 and arrives Bangkok at 05:30. Travel first class in a two berth private sleeper compartment with fresh starched sheets and pillows for a little over 2,000 baht per couple.

Most routes are numbered and colour-coded; pick up a map at the Ubon TAT office.\n\nAlternatively, there are plenty of tuk-tuks puttering and samlors pedaling around. As always, agree on a fare before you get in, and expect to pay 20-40 baht depending on distance and your ",{"type":"[[","value":[["haggling"]]}," skills.\n\nIf you're feeling a little more adventurous, try renting a motorbike or a car to get you to one of the many national parks in the province.
