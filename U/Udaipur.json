Udaipur has an assortment pottery too that can be availed in both metal and mud. Pottery covers all kings of pots, plates, vessels and different kinds of containers. Apart from this, brassware and terracotta sculptures are also popular.\n\nComing to the shopping places, Hathi Pol, Bada Bazaar, Chetak Circle, Bada Bazaar and Palace Road are some of the popular shopping arcades of Udaipur. While shopping in these markets, don't forget to bargain with the shopkeepers to get the value of your money.
