The town is also called as Poor man's ooty because of its climate. Udumalpet is close to many tourist attractions - Palani Temple (35 km), Munnar (88 km), Kodaikanal (100 km) and Thirumoorthy Hills (21 km), Topslip, Aaliyar (35 km).\n\nWaterfalls in Thirumoorthy hills draws quite a number of tourists. It takes half an hour to the falls by trekking from the Thirumoorthy temple. The Thirumoorthy temple is an excellent scenic place with Amanalingeshwarar Thirukkoil at the foot hills. The way atop the hill is pretty exciting up to some 1 km and extremely challenging to go beyond that. It is said if you bend and crawl for about 40 meters beneath a rock behind Panchalingam, you could reach the next layer of Western Ghats, i.e the plain between two adjacent hills and it is said that even tigers exist there.\n\nThe villages surrounding Udumalpet are well known for their beauty. Villages are crisscrossed by Amaravathi river and various irrigation canals. Coconut tree farms are common sight and this area is one of the leading producer of coconuts. The countryside is a popular film shooting spot, providing scenic backgrounds and greenery. Thirumoorthy hills houses a beautiful dam which is a very famous shooting spot for Tamil movies.\n\nUdumalpet lies between the famous temple town of Palani (35 km)and Pollachi (28 km)in the National Highway No.209. Udumalpet is also connected by a metre gauge railway line.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sri RajRajaswari Agencies"]},", 61,Chatram St, phone 225609.
