Bantu-speaking populations, who were probably from central and western Africa, migrated to the southern parts of the country. The Empire of Kitara in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries represents the earliest forms of formal organization, followed by the kingdom of Bunyoro-Kitara, and in later centuries, Buganda and Ankole.\n\nArab traders moved inland from the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa in the 1830s. They were followed in the 1860s by British explorers searching for the source of the Nile. Protestant missionaries entered the country in 1877, followed by Catholic missionaries in 1879. The United Kingdom placed the area under the charter of the British East Africa Company in 1888, and ruled it as a protectorate from 1894. As several other territories and chiefdoms were integrated, the final protectorate called Uganda took shape in 1914. From 1900 to 1920, a sleeping sickness epidemic killed more than 250,000 people.\n\nUganda won independence from Britain in 1962, and the first elections were held on 1 March 1961. Benedicto Kiwanuka of the Democratic Party became the first Chief Minister. Uganda became a republic the following year, maintaining its Commonwealth membership. In succeeding years, supporters of a centralized state vied with those in favour of a loose federation and a strong role for tribally-based local kingdoms. Political manoeuvring climaxed in February 1966, when Prime Minister Milton Obote suspended the constitution and assumed all government powers, removing the positions of president and vice president. In September 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic, gave the president even greater powers, and abolished the traditional kingdoms.\n\nOn 25 January 1971, Obote's government was ousted in a military coup led by the commander of the armed forces, Idi Amin Dada. Amin declared himself 'president,' dissolved the parliament, and amended the constitution to give himself absolute power. Idi Amin's eight-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations. The Acholi and Langi ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army. In 1978, the International Commission of Jurists estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign of terror; some authorities place the figure as high as 300,000. \n\nIn October 1978, Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion of Amin's troops into Tanzanian territory. The Tanzanian army, backed by Ugandan exiles waged a war against Amin's troops and the Libyan soldiers sent to help him. On 11 April 1979, Kampala was captured, and Amin fled with his remaining forces. This led to the return of Obote, who was deposed once more in 1985 by General Tito Okello. Okello ruled for six months until he was deposed after the so-called \"bush war\" by the National Resistance Army (NRA) operating under the leadership of the current president, Yoweri Museveni, and various rebel groups, including the Federal Democratic Movement of Andrew Kayiira, and another belonging to John Nkwanga.\n\nMuseveni has been in power since 1986. In the mid to late 1990s, he was lauded by the West as part of a new generation of African leaders.\n\nRecently, Uganda has been in the news for its controversial law that makes gay sex punishable by life in prison and also makes it a criminal offence not to report an offender.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nAlthough generally equatorial, the climate is not uniform as the altitude modifies the climate. Southern Uganda is wetter with rain generally spread throughout the year. At Entebbe on the northern shore of Lake Victoria, most rain falls from March to June and the November\/December period. Further to the north a dry season gradually emerges; at Gulu about 120 km from the South Sudanese border, November to February is much drier than the rest of the year.\n\nThe northeastern region has the driest climate and is prone to droughts in some years. Rwenzori in the southwest on the border with DR Congo receives heavy rain all year round. The south of the country is heavily influenced by one of the world's biggest lakes, Lake Victoria, which contains many islands.

Chimp trekking and birding takes place in the southern reaches, in Budongo Forest, but the core park activities are centered around the river Nile, and the dramatic Murchison Falls themselves. Launch cruises can be taken to the base of the Falls, offering a relaxed way to enjoy the scenery and the wildlife which comes to the water's edge, including elephant, buffalo, Defassa waterbuck, Nile crocodile and hundreds of hippopotami. The Falls are only modest in their height (approximately a 43 m drop) but what they lack in height they make up for in power. The entire Nile river explodes through a 7 m (23 ft) wide crevice. It is said that up to 300 cubic metres of water per second rush through this narrow rocky gorge. The bird life is also excellent in this area, but to spot the famous Shoebill, it is best to take a Delta cruise in the opposite direction, to where the waters of the Victoria Nile and Albert Nile meet and mingle at the northern end of Lake Albert. The delta area is a network of watery channels with papyrus islands, where plenty of aquatic birds can be spotted, and quite often, the pre-historic looking Shoebill is found fishing for frogs and lungfish. The park also offers game drives around the Buligi circuit in the delta area, or further east and north towards Karuma Falls or Pakwach and Wangkwar gates. The game is not as plentiful as that found in the large national reserves of Kenya and Tanzania, but the wildlife encounters can be more intimate, as Uganda is 'off the beaten path'. Frequently spotted game includes Lion, Leopard, Elephant and Buffalo, as well as the endangered Rothschild's Giraffe, Jackson's Hartebeest, Defassa Waterbuck, Uganda Kob and the dainty Oribi. Access to the park is best with an organised safari tour or a self-drive vehicle. Tracks are basic, so vehicles should engage 4wd and lock hubs, and drivers should keep below the park limit of 40 km\/h. For travellers relying on public transport, it's best to join a budget group tour from Kampala or travel by bus to Masindi and then try and arrange a 'special hire' (private taxi) to take you into the park. The latter will cost up to $100 one way, so a group tour inclusive of all fees etc, can often be the more affordable option if you are travelling by yourself.

There are UGX50,000, 20,000, 10,000, 5000, 2000 and 1000 bank notes and 500, 200, 100, and 50 shilling coins (10, 5, and 1 shilling coins exist but are rarely used).\n\nSome bigger hotels and restaurants do accept US dollars as payment, and safaris and rafting activities (e.g. Red Chillis in Kampala) are often priced in USD. These activities can be paid in UGX, but a poor exchange rate is often offered. Also, there is often an extra fee (typically around 5%) on the use of credit cards. This means that it can be useful to bring USD to cover these activities. The obvious trade-off is that one must carry a large amount of USD around.\n\nATMs accept debit and credit cards throughout the country. VISA-branded cards are accepted by all ATMs, while MasterCard\/Maestro\/Cirrus cards are accepted at Stanbic Bank and Standard Chartered Bank ATMs. Different ATMs allow for different maximum withdrawals of UGX400,000-2,000,000, though the usual amount is UGX700,000. Many ATMs are located at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Entebbe"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Airport"]]},"; given that it is impossible to buy Ugandan shillings outside of Uganda and in countries bordering Uganda, withdrawing shillings from the airport ATMs is the easiest option. \n\nATMs may close due to lack of money or system problems. It is safer to bring VISA cards in case of ATMs issues. MasterCard is not accepted in ATMs, but they can be accepted in major banks for a fee. In Kampala, watch out for pickpockets who follow tourists from one bank's ATM to another when cards are not accepted.\n\nCredit cards are accepted at very few businesses, usually the larger hotels and supermarkets. As for your American Express card: leave it at home. AmEx cannot be used except at major hotels and with airlines. \n\nCashing travellers cheques can be difficult, so don't bother bringing them into Uganda.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Costs"]},"\nFood and goods are cheap.

Never pay face value when buying from the local vendors around town. Hotels can be costly, so if you are a student it would be a good idea to look for a hostel in Kampala.\n\nMost people have to buy a visa when they arrive at the airport; in May 2010 this cost USD50 (single-entry 3 month).

It has a tantalising aroma, and is always served with \"food\", which in Ugandan parlance indicates any carbohydrate. The staple \"food\" varies from region to region, with the plantain matooke in the south, millet in the north, and potatoes in the west.  Cassava, posho (made from ground maize), sweet potatoes and rice are other common \"foods\". The whole fried fish is succulent, though mostly available at the beach, and usually served with chips\/French fries. Other common options around Kampala include the traditional matooke, binyebwa (groundnut sauce), chapati, and meat stew. For the less adventurous, toasted sandwiches or omelets can be found in many places.\n\nIf this does not appeal, it is best (and far more interesting) to stop at roadside stands or markets to purchase fresh produce—fruits and vegetables abound and are very affordable, to say nothing of the roasted chicken or goat on a stick. There are also a number of fast-food places, such as Nando’s, Steers, Domino’s Pizza, and Hungry Lion, all in the city centre.\n\nA basic local dish starts at around UGX1,000, and goes up to UGX5,000 at a local buffet, or even UGX10,000 at a posh hotel. A slice of pineapple from a street vendor can cost as little as 300 shillings.\n\nSee the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fang Fang Hotel"]}," below for good Chinese food in Kampala.

If you go on the higher end you will pay high prices, over $100 per night. Standard traveller hotels will have simple rooms with shared bathrooms for around 3,000 to 10,000 shillings. Many places will rent you a tent, or place to pitch a tent for the budget traveller. There are various budget places in Kampala and Jinja to choose from, to base yourself at, including Red Chilli, Backpackers, Nile River Explorers and Nile River Camp. Some are better than others, and may suit different preferences, so it's best to explore the reviews on Trip Advisor to assess what would be best for you.  A stay in one of these will cost from $5-$15 USD a night, depending on whether you camp or stay in a dorm. They also offer private rooms or safari tents, and some have self-catering cottages which are great for long stay\/groups.

They vary in amenities and price, and the cheapest can be as little as USD5.00 or less per person per night.\n\nFew moderately priced options are available, and the high end, while expensive, are substandard compared to the high end options of Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and other mature tourist destinations in Africa. Unfortunately, few alternatives are available. There are some notable exceptions, but best to go either highest end or stay in the UWA budget accommodations and spend more on a better vehicle!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nUganda has been home to some of the more gruesome atrocities in modern African history since its independence in 1962, particularly under the heinous dictator Idi Amin, but in the years since 1987 things have consistently improved. Today the state is relatively stable after 25 years of stereotypically 'strong man' rule by Yoweri Museveni. Kampala has changed into a major centre of East African trade. \n\nTravel north to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Murchison Falls National Park"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ajai Game Reserve"]]}," is perfectly safe. Note that overlanders from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tanzania"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kenya"]]}," regularly make the trip routing through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jinja"]]},".\n\nAs in any urban area, Kampala can be dodgy. One is well advised to remain in tourist areas, but sensibly garbed visitors not dangling the latest cameras, flashy jewellery or bulging bags are not likely to draw unwanted attention to themselves.\n\nHowever, any Caucasians (or, more generally, any non-black Africans) walking in the street stand out and are likely to be stared at openly, which may cause discomfort to those unaccustomed to travelling in Africa.  Asian individuals will be assumed to be Chinese, and often will be subjected to \"ni hao\" and\/or imitations of Asian languages (e.g. \"Ching chong\").  While potentially offensive to Asian Americans (or Asians raised in similar cultures), it is not necessarily intended to be rude and is almost never a sign of anti-Asian hostility.  What little begging exists is some of the most polite and inoffensive to be found in African cities, nowhere worse than in the West. Small children are sadly becoming a nuisance in some rural spots frequented by tourists doling out sweets and coins but nowhere near the swarming throng one can attract in many cities around the world.\n\nIn the gorilla tracking region of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park"]]}," near the border with the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Democratic Republic of the Congo"]]},", there was one incident in the late 1990s in which bandits attacked a group of tourists and killed several people. Since then, there have been no incidents and all groups now go out with armed guards (which was not the case before). There is a visible security presence in the region, but this is a preventative measure rather than a response to anything specific.\n\nTravellers should still avoid the North Eastern areas as Karimijong attacks have occurred that involved tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["LGBT travellers"]},"\nHomosexuality is illegal in Uganda and attitudes towards LGBT people are extremely hostile. Though 2011's notorious \"Anti-Homosexuality Bill\", which proposed the death penalty for \"repeat offenders\", failed to pass, a revised version that imposes a life sentence did. There is a small underground gay scene in Kampala, but violence is commonplace and gay travellers are advised to be extremely cautious. Various studies have shown that the worst place in the world to be gay or lesbian is Uganda. Hence, if you are gay and choose to visit Uganda, it is advisable to keep your sexual orientation a secret. A recently enacted law has made it illegal for one to know that someone is homosexual and not report it to the authorities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["HIV\/AIDS"]}," infection rate is very high (even though lower than neighbouring countries). ",{"type":"'''","value":["Do not have unprotected sex."]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ebola"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Marburg"]}," hemorrhagic fevers have been endemic within certain regions of the country. The vectors of these viruses are unknown, but have been thought to be linked with bats. Therefore, travellers should avoid (or be extremely cautious when) entering any caves. If you are bitten by an animal, assume that the animal was infected by a disease and seek prompt medical attention. \n\nTake precautions against ",{"type":"'''","value":["malaria"]},"! Malarial mosquitoes are present throughout most lower lying areas of the country. It is worth seeking out a packet of Artenam while you are in Kampala if you are travelling up-country. Artenam is a reliable treatment and works on chloroquine-resistant malaria strains too. \n\nDiarrhoea and intestinal worms are also a concern and travellers should be careful what they eat or drink. Carry hand sanitizer to use before meals. Be sure to wash fresh produce well before eating and avoid raw foods in restaurants. As a precaution, travellers should secure ciprofloxacin before they exit their home country because it can be used as a cure.\n\nRemember, that many of the lakes have ",{"type":"'''","value":["Schistosomiasis"]},". Check with the locals and do not paddle on the lake shore if you're not sure.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\nUganda has a fairly conservative Christian\/Muslim-based society. It is generally not considered acceptable for women to wear skimpy clothing or to overtly display their sexuality.  The only exception is in certain night life situations in Kampala.  Most Ugandans go to church\/mosque regularly and consider religion an important part of a moral society. Never criticize religion in presence of a Ugandan!\n\nYou will not be taken seriously if you wear shorts outside the obvious tourist destinations and most Ugandan adults would never wear shorts except if playing sport. Use a pair of light trousers to blend in better. Most women wear skirts in rural areas, but trousers are acceptable in cities and larger towns.\n\nIn central Kampala women can dress pretty much like in any western big city. Women dressing smartly in tight sleeveless tops, tight jeans, or dresses or skirts that do not cover the knees is a very common sight there. As a foreigner you do not need to avoid dressing up - although for safety reasons it is wise to avoid wearing expensive jewellery or similar accessories. \n\nA handshake is the most common form of greeting.  If your hands are wet or dirty you may offer your wrist instead of your hand.\n\nDon't be surprised if you see two men holding hands.

SIM cards are cheaply available everywhere in 'starter packs' but need to be registered before use.\n\nInternet cafes can be readily found in Kampala and Jinja. In all towns with more than about 20,000 people you'll find internet cafes running off of either VSATs or mobile phones. The Internet connection bandwidth is very low and can be frustrating for those who are used to a high speed internet connection.\n\nMobile broadband (3G, HSDPA, HSPA, HSPA+ [21mbps]) is available in several places. Airtel has mobile broadband available in larger places along Jinja Road. In the more rural areas, a slower (EDGE) connection might be available. Orange also offer mobile broadband. If a mobile broadband connection is desirable on a computer, a good option could be to bring a phone that can set up a Wi-Fi network providing internet access, or one that allows USB tethering. USB broadband modems are also available, at least for Orange, but might be more expensive but also need to be registered before use.\n\nOther networks include MTN (the biggest in Uganda), Warid Telecom and Uganda Telecom.\n\nAn example of price for mobile broadband on a phone through Airtel is UGX25,000 for 1GB traffic in one week.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["1.28"],["32.39"],["zoom=7"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["East Africa"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Uganda"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Africa\/Uganda\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["commons:category:Uganda"]]}]
