Located at the picturesque bank of the Volga River, Uglich is one of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},"'s few historical and well-preserved riverine tourist destinations. The town is often included into the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Golden Ring"]]}," of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},".\n\nThe local population of 34,500 doubles during the summer when this lovely town hosts weekenders from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," and other cities, as well as organized tourist groups brought by buses and ships. Thanks to this popularity, Uglich is changing rapidly from a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},"'s usual backwater provincial place into an attractive point with all necessary infrastructure and the potential for further development.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nUglich is one of the oldest cities of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},". According to archeologists, a settlement at the place of the modern kremlin of Uglich existed roughly since the beginning of Christian era. But it is estimated, that the town was founded in 937 AD. However, Uglich was firstly officially mentioned in chronicles in 1148 AD.\n\nSince 1218 Uglich had been the capital of the small Uglich Princedom until in the beginning of 14th century when the princedom was sold to Muscovia as a part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]}," unification from the feudal fragmentation.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Uglichpalace.jpg"],["thumb"],["250 px"],["Prince Dmitry's palace in Uglich"]]},"\n\nDuring the period of Ivan The Terrible ruling, Uglich helped this ",{"type":"''","value":["tsar"]}," to invade ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kazan"]]},": the locals built a moveable wooden fortress, which was floated down the Volga river. This fortress also acted as the foundation of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sviyazhsk"]]}," town near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kazan"]]},".\n\nAfter Ivan The Terrible's death in 1584 his baby son, the crown prince Dmitry was relocated to Uglich with his mother. Seven years after, on May 15, 1591, the most famous event in Uglich's history happened: young Dmitry was killed. This lead to a civil disorder in the city. After its suppression 200 citizens were executed to death, and Dmitry's mother was forced to take the vows. Left without a ",{"type":"''","value":["tsar'"]},"s successor, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]}," entered one of the darkest periods of its history, known as The Great Disturbance (Великая смута), which finished in 1613 with Romanov Dynasty accession. As for Prince Dmitry, later he was canonized by Russian Orthodox Church as a saint martyr.\n\nDuring The Great Disturbance of 17th century Uglich was ruined by Poles, recovering very slowly after that. It is said by historians that before this devastation, being at the top of its flourishing, Uglich had 3 cathedrals, 150 churches, 12 monasteries, and the population of 40 000 (compare to less than 35 thousand nowadays).\n\nAnother breakdown of the town emerged by the end of 19th century. The absence of railroad connection made Uglich less interesting for business and development, than neighboring cities, where stations were built.\n\nDuring the Soviet period Uglich got its industrial component. In 1939 Uglich Dam was built, flooding many neighboring villages and the central part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kalyazin"]]},". A year after the town finally got the railroad connection. During the WWII Uglich was a base for children evacuation from blockade ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"],["Leningrad"]]},".\n\nAfter the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Soviet Union"]]}," collapse Uglich passed through an industrial decline. In the other hand, the tourist industry of the town started to grow.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nUglich is located outside of major travel hubs and routes (and this makes this town more charming).

The total driving distance from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," to Uglich is 240 km.\n\nAnother option (especially for those who are visiting other ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Golden Ring"]]}," destinations) is to take the ",{"type":"'''","value":["M8"]}," highway to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rostov Veliky"]]},", turning there left to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["P153"]}," road. Longer distance is compensated with a great monastery view at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Borisoglebsky"]]}," (18 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rostov Veliky"]]},").\n\nContinue driving to the north from Uglich will bring you to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Myshkin"]]}," (30 km), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rybinsk"]]}," (72 km), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cherepovets"]]}," (255 km) and, finally, to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]}," (800 km).\n\nExpect the lack or absence of bilingual signage everythere and use satellite navigation if possible.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nBus service to Uglich is relatively frequent and reliable.

Their schedule depends on season, so check the options carefully in advance. A single one-way ticket from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," costs 470 RUR (only 3rd class is available).\n\nAdventurous travellers can also use an option of travelling from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]}," through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bologoye"]]}," - the midpoint station between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},".
