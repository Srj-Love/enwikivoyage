Author Alex Kerr extols its virtues in his book ",{"type":"''","value":["Lost Japan"]},", contrasting Uji favorably with Kyoto as a (rare) example of a historic Japanese city whose modern development has not disrupted its classical beauty.

There is a small tourist information center outside JR Uji station that can provide English maps. There's also a tourist information center next to the Taihō-an Tea House, just east of Byōdō-in. It's possible to sketch out an itinerary covering all of the major sights in a day, but an unplanned stroll along either side of the Uji River is likely to be just as rewarding.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nSince Uji is a place full of tradition, there are many small temples to be found on both sides of the river.

The main statue of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Phoenix Hall"]}," (鳳凰堂 ",{"type":"''","value":["Hōō-dō"]},") represents the Buddha Amida (Amitabha); many people turned to it for refuge from the present and future, and this gave rise to the Pure Land Faith movement of Buddhism. Battles and fires took their toll on Byōdō-in over several hundred years, but a fire during the Edo period proved devastating. Only the Hōō-dō survived intact, protected by a pond. For a quick preview of what you'll see, check your pockets: the Hōō-dō is the temple on the ¥10 coin. The entrance fee also covers the temple's museum, which contains a variety of historical artifacts from the temple. The video and displays are all translated into English, so foreign visitors can easily appreciate the museum artifacts. If you choose to enter to the Phoenix Hall, it costs extra, and you can only enter as a tour (aka: you can't just walk in and out on your own). The tours run every 20 minutes and are limited to 50 people. No photos are allowed inside the Hall, and the tour is only in Japanese, although a written English transcript is provided. Inside, you will see the Buddha statue up close. Don't forget to look at the artwork behind you and on the side walls. An interesting fact that you won't hear on the tour is that in the early 20th century, the Byōdō-in was actually used by many local homeless as a temporary home. They tell visitors that all of the fading just happened over time, but you'll notice the artwork is completely gone on the bottom. This is because the homeless who lived here often wrote graffiti on the walls, so the original artwork was lost, even after the homeless were forced out and restoration was attempted.
