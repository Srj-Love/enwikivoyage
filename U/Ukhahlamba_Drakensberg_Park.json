In autumn the fields and lower reaches of the Drakensberg are often a waist-high sea of confetti-like pink, white and deep velvet red cosmos blossoms. \n\nIn the higher reaches on the slopes of the Little Berg, varieties of protea trees show their prehistoric flowers, and ancient tree ferns and the odd cycad dot the gullies. Hikers should note that there are 24 species of snakes in these mountains, and not all of them are willing to give way to humans!\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Map-South Africa-Ukhahlamba Drakensberg01.png"],["thumb"],["450px"],["Map of the park and surrounding area"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=San Rock Art"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=There are more than 500 caves in the mountains decorated with rock art and this is one of the main reasons why this area has been declared a UNESCO Heritage site.
