UB is one of the most drab looking cities on the face of the planet, a travesty really, considering it's the capital of one the most beautiful and hospitable countries on earth.  Still, as traditionalists, Mongolians love their capital. They understand that it is not an Asian beauty, but in their hearts they are aware of the city's history, culture and many struggles.  Foreigners who take the time to get to know the faces that are hidden behind the gray walls will discover a hospitable and warm-hearted people. Explore the city from different angles, while at the same time do not ignore the abject poverty of many of the ex-nomads who in recent years have come to the city to find work after severe winters have killed their livestock.

In 1651, it became the capital of the first Jebtsundamba Khutughtu, Zanabazar, when he returned from Tibet. The mobile monastery gradually became a mobile city, moving every few years as needed. Urga has moved 25 times between its founding in 1639 and settling in its current location in 1778. By this time, it had several thousand tents and temples and was served by trade routes from China and Russia. It was also estimated to have about 10,000 monks. The Gandan Monastery was established in 1809 and became the center of learning for all of Mongolia, and one of the most important monasteries in Tibetan Buddhism. The city continued to grow as a provincial capital of Qing Empire and a center of religion and trade through the 19th century. In 1911, the 8th Bogd Khan declared independence from China, leading to a long unstable period in the city's history including an occupation by a Chinese warlord in 1919. However, the Chinese were kicked out by the White Russian, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, aka the \"Mad Baron\", in 1921. This forced the Soviets to intervene and set up a puppet state in what was then known as Outer Mongolia. In 1924, the city's name changed from Urga to Ulaanbaatar (\"Red Hero\"). Many of the monasteries and temples were destroyed in the religious purges of the 1930s. Following the end of the 2nd World War, the old ger districts were largely cleared out for Soviet-style city apartments, offices, and factories. The Trans-Mongolian Railway was completed in 1956, connecting Ulaanbaatar to Beijing and Moscow. Gandan Monastery was reopened during a visit by US Vice President Henry Wallace in 1944 when he asked to see a monastery. Since the democratic revolution in 1990, the population of the city more than doubled to over a million with thousands moving in from the countryside. The commercial and residential real estate sectors have boomed since 2000, though large factories have closed and much of the city still lives in gers districts.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = -16"],["febhigh = -11"],["marhigh =  -2"],["aprhigh =  8"],["mayhigh =  17"],["junhigh =  22"],["julhigh =   23"],["aughigh =   22"],["sephigh =   16"],["octhigh =   7"],["novhigh =   -4"],["dechigh =   -14"],["janlow =   -27"],["feblow =   -24"],["marlow =  -15"],["aprlow =   -6"],["maylow =  3"],["junlow =   8"],["jullow =   11"],["auglow =  9"],["seplow =  2"],["octlow =   -6"],["novlow =   -16"],["declow =   -24"],["janprecip =  1.1"],["febprecip =  1.7"],["marprecip =  2.7"],["aprprecip =  8.3"],["mayprecip =  13"],["junprecip =  42"],["julprecip =  58"],["augprecip =  52"],["sepprecip =  26"],["octprecip =  6.4"],["novprecip =  3.2"],["decprecip =  2.5"],["description = NOAA (1961-1990)"]]},"\nAlthough summer temperatures are around 20°C, the city shivers in sub-zero temperatures for five months of the year, with January and February being the coldest months with temps hovering between -15°C to -30°C.

If you've been attacked or pick-pocketed, please take time to make a deposition at the district police station, and to say it to your embassy if you have one.\n\nWalking on the streets at any time is a hazardous affair as one needs to contend with ice from about October to March, open manholes and extremely chaotic and wild driving habits. Thankfully, the center is now well lit with new streetlights. Drivers (including buses and police) pay no attention to pedestrian crossings and will not reduce speed, but simply sound their horns.

Locals simply stick out an arm and hitchhike anywhere around town. However, it is wise to get a local to interpret if possible and explain the fare system. You should also pay attention to where it is going. Sometimes unmarked taxi drivers will try to take people, especially drunk tourists, down a dark alley and demand your cell phone or cash.\n\nChild beggars are common and persistent on the streets, but watch out for groups of them, as one may be trying to pick your pocket.  Also be aware that any money you do donate will often go straight to their teenage \"pimps\", and so you may not be helping them as much as you think.\n\nWalking at night in company shouldn't be too great of a concern, it isn't for the locals. But stick to areas where you can see lots of locals (especially women) and major streets. Coming out of Bars late at night is a little dangerous if you are alone, try to have several males in your group. Also, it is best to avoid the ger districts at night due to drunks, stray dogs, and lots of dark alleys.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Publications"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=UB Post"],["url=http:\/\/ubpost.mongolnews.mn\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=One of the oldest English language newspapers founded in 1996.
