Uliastai was the de facto capital of Outer Mongolia and parts of what is now Russia, as the Qing Amban, the Governor General, located its office in Uliastai to keep eye on the Khalkh Mongols to the east and the Oirad Mongols west of the Khangai mountains. At its peak, the fortress held up to 3500 soldiers and was surrounded by a Chinese trading quarter, or Maimaicheng. However, during the Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1911 the Military Governor of Uliastai, his staff, and military guards, fled the fort under the protection of Cossack troops. Traces of Manchu rule can still be seen in Uliastai: the stone remnants of the governors fortress near the Bogdiin river are a short walk from town, the shackles and torture devices used by the Manchu are on display in the History Museum, and a hatag-laden stone near the central roundabout is carved with Chinese characters.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =  -15.0"],["febhigh =  -11.2"],["marhigh =  -1.6"],["aprhigh =  8.2"],["mayhigh =  16.6"],["junhigh =  21.6"],["julhigh =  22.4"],["aughigh =  20.8"],["sephigh =  15.4"],["octhigh =  7.0"],["novhigh =  -5.3"],["dechigh =  -13.5"],["janlow =  -28.3"],["feblow =   -26.0"],["marlow =  -17.0"],["aprlow =   -6.2"],["maylow =  1.2"],["junlow =  6.9"],["jullow =   9.0"],["auglow =  7.1"],["seplow =  0.8"],["octlow =   -7.2"],["novlow =   -18.7"],["declow =  -25.7"],["janprecip =  2.1"],["febprecip =  1.7"],["marprecip =  4.8"],["aprprecip =  9.2"],["mayprecip =  14.8"],["junprecip =  34.0"],["julprecip =  54.9"],["augprecip =  48.2"],["sepprecip =  21.7"],["octprecip =  9.3"],["novprecip =  4.6"],["decprecip =  3.2"],["description = NOAA (1961-1990)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nYou can either fly or take the bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulaanbaatar"]]}," to Uliastai.
