There is a bus between Dodong-ri to Jeodong-ri every 30 minutes. For the latest timetable tourist information should have the most up-to-date schedule. As of November 2011, the basic fare is ₩1,000 to travel between Dodong and Jeodong. All other fares are ₩1,500. Bear in mind that buses do stop running a lot earlier than on the mainland (last buses depart before 20:00), as it is difficult to get a taxi at night unless you are in Dodong or Jeodong.\n\nSince convenient transportation is scarce, taxis may be a good option to get around the island. You can catch them at the Dodong Port when you get off the boat. A taxi ride around the island should cost you around ₩80,000 to ₩90,000 a day. There is also the option to rent a car although knowing someone who speaks the language would be a big plus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ullengdo 20081114.JPG"],["thumb"],["400px"],["A November view from a high place"]]},"\nRich in tourist attractions, Ulleungdo will not leave you wanting for things to see. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Nari 'Bunji' Basin"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=north of Seonginbong"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A caldera basin and the largest flat area on the island.
