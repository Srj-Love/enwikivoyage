The city is known for its whaling heritage and more recently as the industrial heart of the country. \n\nWhile Ulsan is not listed in many tourist guides, it is the gateway to the Yeongnam Alps, considered to be one of the most beautiful national parks in South Korea. It also has twelve designated \"Scenic Areas\", from natural icons to man made buildings.  Today the city lives in a Catch-22 situation; in some districts it is impossible to escape the industries.  Although these industrial sites are breath-taking in scope, a testament to the achievement of man, they blight the landscape. On the other hand, the investment from these industries undeniably makes the city an better place to be.\nUlsan was a World Cup 2002 host city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\nUlsan City is located 70km north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Busan"]]},", but also close to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gyeongju"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Daegu"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pohang"]]},". \n\nUlsan includes 4 wards (\"Gu\") and 1 county (\"Gun\"):\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Buk-gu (북구; 北區) - The most northern the four Gu and rapidly developing due to the lack of pollution in the area."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Dong-gu (동구; 東區) - The location of Bangeojin, Hyundai and a large amount of the city's ship building industry (including the largest ship-yard in the world)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Jung-gu (중구; 中區)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Nam-gu (남구; 南區)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Ulju-gun (울주군; 蔚州郡)"]},"\nSamsandong, home of the Lotte and Hyundai department stores, can be considered the up-market district. Western fashion brands are available along with a number of western chain restaurants. The neon lit back streets yield a vibrant bar and restaurant culture. The Lotte Ferris wheel is also in this area next to the Lotte Cinema.\nOld down-town, Seongnamdong, is good for shopping at low, local prices (there are brand goods shops too however). It is the location of a small number of foreigner friendly\/foreigner run bars.\nMugeodong, the home of Ulsan University, is the best place for the young, twenty-somethings wishing to eat, drink and party.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["When to visit"]},"\nThe best months tend to be from March through May before it gets too hot. Summer serves up a heavy sweat-inducing humidity along with prolonged rain showers mixed with the occasional typhoon. It remains warm until late October (cited by many to be the best month) at which point the weather turns cold. But it is not uncommon even in December to have warm spells with temperatures plummeting at night. Ulsan sees little snow due to its southerly position on the Korean peninsular and polluted atmosphere - however that is not to say that snow can not fall. When it does fall, it can be heavy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nAs Ulsan receives no international flights it is only possible to arrive in the city via the air from two destinations - Seoul (Gimpo) and Jeju-do.\n\nGetting to Ulsan by plane from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Incheon International Airport"]]}," Airport requires a transfer upon landing to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seoul"]]}," Gimpo Airport. It is best to do this via the limousine bus service, which departs from in front of the main terminal at Incheon International Airport every five minutes. The journey then takes about thirty minutes and the fare is ₩6,000. Be sure to listen to the announcements on the bus as it will inform you of which terminal you need for your onward flight. \n\nThe flight from Gimpo (",{"type":"''","value":["operated by Korean Air and Asiana"]},") takes about one hour.

(",{"type":"''","value":["The tourist information booth on the ground floor is a must before leaving the airport for great maps of the city and many leaflets on things to do.

Departures from Ulsan Airport are at 8:20 11:40 16:10 18:40. Departures from Gyeongju Express Bus Terminal, Platform No.5 are at: 7:00, 10:10, 14:30, 17:20.\n\nAnother option is to fly into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Busan"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gimhae International Airport"]]}," which is about an hour and a half away by bus.\n\nIf you are flying in directly to Incheon International Airport, it may be more convenient to take the bus from the airport directly to Ulsan.

It is for the most part very inconveniently located, being further away from downtown then even the airport, however Ulsan City is accessible by bus from the station.\n\nThe regular city buses (yellow and white) cost ₩1,150 when using cash, or ₩1,100 when using a transportation card, and are the cheapest, although not the most comfortable way or quickest to get to the city center.  The 327, 337 and 807 all run to Samsan-dong, which is the downtown of Ulsan, while other routes stay outside of the city core. These buses do not use the expressway and even makes some stops that are somewhat out of the way, so they may take considerably longer than the buses below to the city center.\n\nOne Chwaseok (seated) bus line runs as well to the KTX station, route number 1703.  It costs ₩1,700 by cash, or ₩1,500 using a transportation card.  It uses the expressway to the city center, so it is quicker and has more comfortable seats as the regular city buses.\n\nThere are also four express buses (5000 series) which run from the station to various parts of the city.  They cost ₩3,200 when paid in cash, or ₩3,000 by transportation card.  These buses have the most comfortable seats and make limited amounts of stops along the way.  While not very high frequency (about 2 departures per hour), they are timed to depart after the trains arrive at Ulsan station.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Standard trains"]},"\n\nThe existing non high speed Ulsan station has been renamed to Taehwagang (Taehwa River) Station, while only the new KTX station is now named Ulsan station.\n\nWith the start of direct KTX service to Ulsan, there are no longer any slow (Saemaul or Mugunghwa) trains that go to Seoul.  Most now terminate in Dongdaegu Station and Bujeon station in Busan, with a few runs to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pohang"]]}," and other places.\n\nTaehwagang station is situated a brisk twenty minutes walk from the center of Samsandong following the main road straight ahead after going outside. Look for the iconic Lotte Ferris wheel. Walking from the Lotte Ferris Wheel is truly a brisk walk!  Taxis provide a better mode of transportation to the Taehwagang Station, and gives you the advantage of not carrying your backpack or luggage along the sidewalks.\n\nWhen travelling between Busan and Ulsan, it is worth taking the train since the sight varies from the endless industrial backdrop of Ulsan to some breathtaking views of the sea along the way to Busan.  The part especially near Haeundae is very nice as the route circles around the Dalmaji hill gives an endless view of the ocean.  Just a point to be taken however is that this line is under construction for an upgrade from single track to double track, and the part around Haeundae is being completely rerouted away from the sea meaning these sea views won't last for long.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nGetting to Ulsan by car is simple enough using the national expressway system:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" From Seoul, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Daejeon"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Daegu"]]},", take the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gyeongbu Expressway"]}," towards Busan and exit at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Eonyang junction"]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" From Gwangju, take the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Namhae Expressway"]}," towards Busan and exit at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wonyang junction"]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chuncheon"]]},", take the Jungang Expressway towards Daegu, then switch to the Gyeongbu Expressway towards Busan at Geumho junction."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eumseong"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cheongju"]]}," take the Jungbu Expressway towards Daejeon and then switch to the Gyeongbu Expressway towards Busan at Nami junction."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nUlsan is well served by intercity buses and it is possible to get to the city from any other major (and not so major) location in the country.

The cost is ₩2,000 if you use a transportation card, or ₩2,200 if you pay in  cash. Alternately you can also use the Intercity bus which runs the same route, but makes less stops, so it is slightly quicker and has very comfortable seats (only three per row).  Buses are very frequent (once every 7 minutes during the daytime) with the last departures at 2 AM from both sides.  The cost is ₩4,000 which goes up to ₩5,900 after 10PM.

Upon exiting the first bus be sure to place the card over the box with an X and O to initiate the free transfer.\n\nThe cards can be bought and refilled at the vendor shacks located next to any major bus stop in the city. Depending on design it should cost no more than ₩5,000. This does not include any credit which must be paid for in addition.

This makes long distance bus travel economical, but for short trips not so much.\n\nBuses run until about 11:30PM in the evening after this they start again early in the morning. Perhaps around 5AM in some areas. The smaller blue buses only circuit the immediate local area many times a day. These cost ₩600 or more.\n\nStep onto the bus at the front with exact change if possible. Drivers do give change but nothing more than a few hundred won.
