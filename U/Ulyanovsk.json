It is very affordable (10 RUR ~ $0.30 per trip), but congested and may be quite confusing. You won't find any route maps or schedules, neither at bus stops nor in buses. Fee collectors usually don't speak English. Express buses and semi-private van routes are more comfortable and more expensive.  Taxis are not expensive (9 RUR — 0.20 EUR per km), and that's your best bet if you want to get somewhere (relatively) quickly, in (relative) comfort (almost all cars are old Russian ladas or over 10 year old non-Russian cars), and without much hassle. They are also most likely to have English speaking drivers (one in 1000) and superloud Russian pop music.\n\nGetting between the banks of the Volga is a problem. There is a two lane bridge connecting the banks and it's nearly always congested, so if you're unlucky, it can take a couple of hours. Most locals avoid going over the bridge if they can. There is a new four lane bridge due for completion in 2010 that is supposed to relieve these problems.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nAs the home town of Lenin, it's worth visiting the Lenin Memorial Centre and Gardens and museums based in his former houses.
