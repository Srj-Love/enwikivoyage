Temperatures can rise over 40C (104F) in the peak of the summer and the humidity levels are high. Rainfall is minimal and averages 42 millimetres a year. The coastline experiences cooling sea breezes during the day.\n\nThe name Umm Al Quwain is derived from Umm Al Quwatain, which means \"Mother of two powers\", a reference to the powerful seafaring tradition of this emirate. The modern history of Umm Al Quwain dates back some 200 years when the Al Ali tribe moved their capital from Al Sinniyah Island to its present location in the mid 18th century, when the sweet water supply dried up.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThere is no airport in Umm al Quwain itself, however there are airports in nearby emirates ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abu Dhabi"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Al Ain"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubai"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sharjah"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ras al Khaimah"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are no buses in Umm al Quwain.
