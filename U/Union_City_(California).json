To preclude such an event, a citizen's committee petitioned for incorporation; and on January 13, 1959, the City of Union City came into being, binding together the four townships of Union City\/New Haven\/Alvarado\/Decoto. Tom Kitayama, who served on the citizen's committee, became its first mayor. He was the first Japanese American to hold public office in California, just 14 years after the end of World War II.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Public Transportation"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["AC Transit ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.actransit.org\/"]}]}," buses bring you in from Contra Costa county and the rest of Alameda county."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["BART ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bart.gov\/index.aspx"]}]}," trains bring you to the Union City BART Station from Fremont to the south and from Hayward, San Leandro, Oakland and Richmond to the north, as well as San Francisco to the west."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Dumbarton Express ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/transit.511.org\/schedules\/index.aspx#m1=S&m2=bus&cid=DE"]}]}," buses bring you in from Palo Alto via Dumbarton Bridge."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nCycling, walking, and taking public transportation are all alternatives to driving, although traffic isn't bad relatively speaking and free parking is plentiful.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Union City Transit ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.union-city.ca.us\/transit.html"]}]}," operates four bus routes, which are coordinated with BART trains, AC Transit, and the Dumbarton Express to areas outside the city.
