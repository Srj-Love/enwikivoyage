Many of the shops and restaurants are independently owned. Because Bergenline is a one-way southbound street, it is very congested to drive through during most hours of the day. Starting on the north end of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#First Street Park"],["Washington Park"]]},", the first several blocks are mostly residential. After walking from the park a few blocks, businesses begin to emerge. Buildings on Bergenline span three centuries; many still standing from the 19th Century.\n\nThe entire northern section of Bergenline, from 32nd to 47th Street, is particularly interesting to walk, as many buildings from the 19th century and early 20th century are still standing; as a result, this district is listed on the New Jersey Historic Preservation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:8.14.09StMichaelsMonasteryByLuigiNovi.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Monastery and Church of Saint Michael the Archangel"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Monastery and Church of Saint Michael the Archangel"]}," - 19th Century grand church, the largest of its time.
