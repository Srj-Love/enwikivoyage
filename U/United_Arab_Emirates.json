To some, it is an advanced and clean country, to others a touristy \"Disneyland\". For most Western tourists, the UAE offers an environment that is extremely familiar. The malls are extraordinarily modern, filled with virtually any product available in the West (save sexually explicit material – movies are censored, as are magazines to some extent). The less well known side of the UAE includes remote, magnificent desert dunes on the edge of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Empty Quarter"]]}," and craggy, awe-inspiring wadis in the north-east bordering ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oman"]]},".\n\nThe roads and other public facilities are modern if, at times, extremely crowded. Supermarkets offer a vast assortment of products from Europe and the U.S., depending on the shop, along with local and regional items. Major international chains such as Ikea, Carrefour, and Geant have a presence and fast-food chains (nearly all from the U.S.) such as McDonald's and KFC operate widely. On the other hand, there are still a few crowded traditional ",{"type":"''","value":["souks"]}," filled with products from around the world and rug stores. These can be hard to find for the average traveler, as the malls tend to gain an overwhelming amount of attention. (Contrary to what is printed in some guidebooks, the souks in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abu Dhabi"]]}," were torn down in 2006 and no longer exist. The souks in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubai"]]}," are still wonderful to explore, though).\n\nAlcohol is widely available at many restaurants and bars in Dubai and in the tourist hotels of every other emirate save ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sharjah"]]},". There is a legal but roundly overlooked requirement to have a license to buy alcohol in liquor stores (of which there are few). The alcohol license is proof that the bearer is a non-Muslim. A passport will not suffice. However, you can purchase alcohol duty-free at the airport to bring into the UAE. Sharjah emirate is completely dry. An alcohol license is required in the emirates of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ajman"]]},"; the remaining emirates of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ras Al Khaimah"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujairah"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Umm al Quwain"]]}," do not require any type of license. The requirement is sometimes overlooked at certain stores.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Politics"]},"\nThe United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven emirates, each with its own sheikh (or king). Each emirate retains considerable autonomy, most notably over oil revenues. In theory, the President and Prime Minister are elected by the Supreme Council, which is composed of the kings of each of the seven emirates. In practice, the king of Abu Dhabi is always elected President while the king of Dubai is always elected Prime Minister, making the posts ",{"type":"''","value":["de facto"]}," hereditary.  As a result the rulers – or sheikhs – of each emirate are revered and can radically affect the way of life in their emirate. For example, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai is very modern, so Dubai is currently forward-thinking and cosmopolitan. The ruling sheikhs of Ajman and Sharjah are more conservative, thus the rules there are more strict concerning religion, alcohol, and general living conditions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe country is extraordinarily dry, getting only a few days of rain a year. Despite that, Emiratis use water at an alarming rate: there are broad swaths of grass in the major public parks, for example, and landscaping can be extensive in the resorts or other public places. Most of this water comes from desalination. Visitors do not pay for their water use. The weather from late October through mid-March is quite pleasant, with temperatures ranging from highs around 27°C (85°F) to lows around 15°C (63°F). It is almost always sunny. Rain can fall between November and February, and can cause road hazards when it does. In the summer, temperatures soar and humidity is close to unbearable – it is widely suspected that the officially reported temperatures are \"tweaked\" to cut off the true summer highs, which can go above 50°C, or 120°F.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Infobox"],["One Emirates, many Peoples"],["After landing in UAE, you might not think it is an Arab country.

Only 20% are 'real' Emiratis; the rest come from the Indian subcontinent: India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh (50%); other parts of Asia, particularly the Philippines, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka (another perhaps 15%); and \"Western\" countries (Europe, Australia, North America, South Africa; 5-6%), with the remainder from everywhere else. On any given day in Dubai or Sharjah, for example, you can see people from every continent and every social class. With this diversity, one of the few unifying factors is language, and consequently nearly everyone speaks some version of English. Nearly all road or other information signs are in English and Arabic, and English is widely spoken, particularly in the hospitality industry. There are elements that some overseas travelers may be unaccustomed to, such as fully veiled women, but as this is \"their way\", tourists should show respect and will be offered the same in turn.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Holidays"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["ramadandates"]]},"\n\nThe weekend in the UAE for most government and public services as well as businesses runs from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Friday to Saturday"]},"; for many, Thursday may be a half day (although most often work all day Saturdays).

Restaurants (outside tourist hotels) stay closed during the daylight hours, and while most offices and shops open in the morning from 8AM to 2PM or so, they usually close in the afternoon while people wait (or sleep) out the last hours of the fast.  After sundown, people gather to break their fast with a meal known as ",{"type":"''","value":["iftar"]},", often held in outdoor tents (not uncommonly air-conditioned in the UAE), which traditionally starts with dates and a sweet drink.

The Dubai Metro's peak times are early mornings and early evenings. There are 3 classes offered by the Dubai Metro: Silver Class, used by the working-class people daily; Women's Class, only for women and children; and Gold Class. You could get monthly passes for each class if you are a frequent traveller. The metro also connects with the public buses once you get off a station. You can also plan your route online on www.rta.ae. Travelling by the metro has its own perks as it is relatively cheap, fast and in the meantime you could see most of Dubai en route. The roads are generally in excellent condition; however, signage is poor in some of the emirates.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By public transport"]},"\nPublic transportation within cities remains rudimentary. Dubai is building an extensive monorail and train system, but the other emirates offer very little public transportation. Abu Dhabi has a network of city buses that cost Dh2 per trip if within the city and DH4 per tirip outside the city and are fairly reliable, but can be overcrowded for male passengers. Intercity bus services are fast, comfortable and reasonably frequent.\n\nIn the cities of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah, taxis are widely available. They are relatively cheap in Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. A ride to anywhere within the city of Abu Dhabi will cost approximately US$2, as they charge solely by distance traveled. A night surcharge of US$3 may be added after 10PM, depending on your driver.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe UAE has a modern road system.\nRenting a car or driving in the UAE requires an international driver's license, which is simply a translation of your standard license and can be acquired at a local automobile association. If you have UAE residency status, you must obtain a local driver's license. This can be a simple process that must be completed and can be done in 20 min but only if you are from a specific list of countries (predominantly Western). If you are from an Asian country, you currently have to undergo 40 classes at a local driving school and get through a pretty tough license exam. This is changing, though, and it may apply to all nationalities soon.\n\nCar rentals are slightly cheaper than in the US. There is a flat fee per day for renting a car, based upon the car's size. Petrol (gasoline) is, by US and European standards, inexpensive. The road system is based along British or European standards, with many roundabouts and highly channeled traffic. But the signs are readily understandable and are, in most places, clear and coherent. Drivers in the UAE, particularly in the urban areas, tend to be highly aggressive and often use tactics that range from the stupid to the disastrous. This may perhaps stem from the traffic, which can be extremely congested in the urban areas, or from other factors.\n\nPeople in the UAE drive ",{"type":"''","value":["extremely"]}," fast, and some are completely reckless: overtaking by the right is the rule, speed limits are ignored by many, even heavy trucks. Last-second line change seems to be a national sport. The UAE has the third-highest death rate from traffic accidents in the world (just behind Saudi and Oman).\n\nBe especially careful when you spot a tinted-window SUV at night: the black windows make the driver not see you and change lanes. Theoretically forbidden, tinting windows is widespread among young Arabs and is generally associated with poor driving skills and fast driving.\n\nThere are now some good local city maps, particularly for Dubai (the ",{"type":"''","value":["Explorer"]}," series of books). Be aware that construction is on-going, sometimes rapidly changing the road networks, so maps capture only a \"point in time.\" Sharjah remains poorly mapped. A website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ae.map24.com"]}," offered the first decent online maps of the UAE. Google Earth does offer solid satellite pictures but at a level of detail good mainly for broad reference purposes. The lack of good maps or signage makes the use of a compass or GPS sometimes useful if you want to get off the highway. \n\nDesert safaris or \"wadi bashing\" are good attractions in the vicinity of Dubai, but great care needs to be taken while choosing a hired vehicle; it should be a four wheel drive. Desert safaris are also generally pre-designed with travel agents and can give you good deal as well on quantity.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThe official language is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arabic phrasebook"],["Arabic"]]},", but it is safe to say that the majority of the population doesn't speak it (Iranian, Indian, Asian and Western expatriates are  more numerous than Arabs in Dubai, and usually have very limited knowledge of Arabic). English is the ",{"type":"''","value":["lingua franca"]},". As the UAE was a British protectorate, most locals would have learnt English in school and would know at least basic English.\n\nOther languages widely spoken in the UAE include Hindustani (Hindi & Urdu), Malayalam\/Tamil, Farsi (Persian), and Tagalog (Filipino). Most people possess at least a basic command of English, though it is not uncommon to meet people whose English is limited.\n\nIn Dubai, most shops, hotels, and commercial businesses conduct business in English. Generally speaking, Arabic is spoken by government departments and the police; however, in Abu Dhabi and in the Northern Emirates, Arabic is much more widely spoken.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Fossil Cliff UAE -Paolo Rossetti Weekenduae.com 2012-03-23-.jpg"],["thumb"],["Fossils in a cliff face in the UAE"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Some of the largest sand dunes in the world in the south of Abu Dhabi in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liwa Oasis"]]}," area"]},{"type":"*","value":["Beautiful beaches on the east coast"]},{"type":"*","value":["Rugged, remote wadis in the northern emirates"]},{"type":"*","value":["Archeological sites and natural rock formations in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hajar Mountains"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["Resplendent oases in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Al Ain"]]}]},"\nAlthough at first glance the outdoors may seem dull and uninteresting, and even dangerous due to the desert conditions, there are actually amazing natural destinations in the UAE - the difficulty is in knowing where to find them!

There are long stretches of white-sand beaches, ranging from completely undeveloped to highly touristed (even in cities like Dubai). The snorkeling and diving can be magnificent, especially along the eastern (Indian Ocean) coast. Vast swaths of desert stretch to the south of the major urban areas, offering dramatic views and terrifying rides in fast-driven safaris. The mountains are dramatic, steep rocky crags, and a visit to them (for example, the town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hatta"]]},") is well rewarded with amazing views. Women wearing bathing suits will draw unwanted attention at the public beaches; it is advisable to pay for a one-day entry pass to a private beach at a hotel.\n\nThere are plenty of man-made wonders to enjoy as well. Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi is the world's largest indoor theme park, and as the name suggests, is centered around experiencing the world of Ferrari, which is alongside the Yas Marina Circuit, which hosts the Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand Prix. The Yas Marina Circuit is widely known as the most technologically advanced circuit on the planet, and, along with Formula One, hosts various national and international racing series, including the GP2 and GP3 series, V8 Supercars and the now-defunct FIA GT1 series. It opened in 2009. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the tallest building in the world, and visitors can travel up it to a viewing station situated near the building's peak to enjoy stunning views of the city and beyond. Wild Wadi and Aquaventure are two world class water parks that cater to the whole family. As well as this, those looking for proper retail therapy can visit Dubai Mall, one of the largest shopping malls in the world, and also the location of the world's largest dancing fountain, with multiple shows starting after sunset, and one of the world's largest indoor aquariums, Dubai Aquarium.\n\nSki Dubai in Dubai Emirates Mall opened in 2005. It is the world's third largest indoor ski slope, measuring 400 metres and using 6000 tons of snow. Ski Dubai resort ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.skidubai.com\/"]}," is the first UAE indoor ski slope to open, and more are planned. All equipment, except for gloves and a hat, are provided—skis\/snowboards, snowsuits, boots and socks are all included in the price (the socks are disposable). The adjoining ski store sells equipment, including gloves. A ski slope in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ra's al Khaymah"]]}," is also in the works.\n\n\"Desert safari\" trips can be a fun experience for tourists. They can be booked ahead, but can often be booked as late as the day before, and most hotel receptionists can arrange this for you.  Trips normally start late afternoon and end late evening.  You will be collected from your hotel and driven to the desert in a 4x4 vehicle. Most packages include a heart-pumping drive over the dunes, a short camel ride, an Arabic buffet and a belly dancer. Another option would be renting\/buying a 4x4 and joining the many growing 4x4 clubs in the UAE, which are varied and each carry their own different flavour: ad4x4 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ad4x4.com"]},", uaeoffroaders ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.uaeoffroaders.com"]},",  arabianoffroader ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/arabianoffroader.com"]},", me4x4 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/me4x4.com"]},", emarat4x4 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/emarat4x4.com"]},", etc. They offer a free learning experience for all newcomers with scheduled weekly trips to suit all levels of driving skills. Some of them have over 2,000 members from many nationalities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe currency is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["United Arab Emirates dirham"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["AED"]},", local abbreviation ",{"type":"''","value":["dhs"]},"). It is pegged to the USD at 3.67 AED for $1. Conversion rates are 5 AED for 1 EUR and 6 AED for 1 GBP.\nNotes are in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 dirhams. There is a one dirham coin with sub-units of 25 and 50 fils coins (100 fils = 1 dirham). There are 5 fils and 10 fils coins but these are rarely seen (and provide an excuse for traders to 'short change').\n\nCash and travellers' cheques can be changed at exchanges located at the airports or in all the major shopping malls.  ATMs are numerous and generously distributed.  They accept all the major chain cards: Visa, Cirrus, Maestro etc.  Credit cards are widely accepted.\n\nIf you pay with an overseas credit card, most merchants will attempt to apply ",{"type":"''","value":["dynamic currency conversion"]},", charging several percent more than the issuer conversion would have cost. The credit card terminal will offer the choice of whether the conversion should be accepted. The merchant will ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," ask you about this, and will choose to accept the conversion. If you pay attention, you can intervene and ask for \"No\" to be answered. If you ask upfront, some merchants will have no idea what you mean, but many will.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Costs"]},"\nBasic commodities used to be cheaper than in most Western countries, although this is changing rapidly (Dubai has moved up the ranking to be the 25th most expensive city to live in; Abu Dhabi is close behind). Hotels rates are not cheap—there is a shortage of hotel rooms available, especially in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, which keeps the hotels often at above 90% occupancy. Vast numbers of new hotels are scheduled to come on line during the next five to ten years, but as tourism is on the rise, it is unlikely that prices will come down. All things touristy also tend to be rather expensive. Rents in Dubai are starting to compete with cities like Paris or London, and other prices tend to follow. Some places have shared accommodations available and are quite reasonable.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shopping"]},"\nOne of the things the UAE is most famous for is shopping. There are no sales taxes in the UAE, but it is very difficult to find any real bargains anymore as inflation is at an all-time high. If you are interested in shopping, you can't leave the UAE without visiting Dubai. Dubai boasts the best places for shopping in the whole of the Middle East, especially during the annual shopping festival, usually from mid-January to mid-February.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Arabic MixedGrill.JPG"],["thumb"],["240px"],["A fancy Arabic mixed grill. Clockwise from top: lamb ",{"type":"''","value":["kofta"]},", chicken ",{"type":"''","value":["shish tawuk"]},", beef ",{"type":"''","value":["shish kebab"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["pilaf"]}," (Arabic rice), vegetables."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubai"]]}," and, to a lesser extent, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abu Dhabi"]]}," offer a vast spread of food from most of the world's major cuisines.  By Western standards most restaurants are quite affordable although it is easy to find extremely expensive food too. Most upper-end restaurants are located in hotels.\n\nDue to the large expat populations, Indian and Pakistani restaurants abound, offering affordable and succulent choices. Also popular are Lebanese, Syrian and Jordanian cuisine restaurants.\n\nA popular favorite is grilled chicken, available at most of the open-air cafeterias by the roadside which can be relished with other accompaniments like Khubz (Arabic Bread), hummus, etc., and the most popular rice dish is Biriyani, with grilled chicken or fish or lamb. Traditional Shawarma and falafel sandwiches are readily available and are quite cheap and delicious.\n\nVery few traditional Emirati dishes are served at restaurants; and the closest is the Mendi-style cuisine of Yemen, in which platters of fragrant rice are topped with lamb, chicken or fish that has been slow-roasted in a pit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nDubai has a burgeoning nightlife scene and even formerly straitlaced Abu Dhabi has loosened up and tried to catch up.  Alcohol is available in alcohol stores, 5-star hotel restaurants and bars in all emirates except Sharjah, where you can only drink in your home or in an expat hangout called the Sharjah Wanderers. As a tourist, you are permitted to buy alcohol in bars and restaurants to drink there. If you are a resident, you're supposed to have an alcohol license (never asked for in bars) which also allows you to buy alcohol at alcohol stores (they do check).\n\nDuring Ramadan, no alcohol is served during daylight (fasting) hours.  Dubai and Abu Dhabi permit bars to serve alcohol at night, but bands stop playing, background music is off or quiet, no dancing is allowed and nightclubs are usually closed.  On certain holy days in the Islamic calendar, no alcohol is served publicly in any of the UAE.\n\nDo ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," under any circumstance drink and drive in the UAE. If by chance you are in an accident, this becomes a card for going directly to jail — especially during Ramadan. Taxis are widely available if you have been drinking and are a much safer and wiser option given the insane driving habits in the region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nFor the visitor, the UAE has one of the most spectacular ranges of tourist accommodations in the world. There are staggeringly beautiful, modern hotels, which can be staggeringly expensive, along with more modest housing. Low-cost accommodations are available but, as anywhere, vary alarmingly as to their condition. \n\nThere is an impressive number of super-luxury hotels, most notably the sail-shaped Burj al-Arab (Tower of the Arabs), a Dubai landmark popularly known as a \"7-star hotel\" — a nonexistent category, but still opulent by any standard.  The Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi also aspires to the same standards, at a fraction of the price.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nEmiratis are proud but welcoming people and, when not in their cars, are generally extremely civil and friendly. Like most peoples of the world, they welcome visitors who are willing to show some amount of respect and can be extremely generous. (Some expats and visitors do not understand that revealing clothing can be quite offensive to some people, even if nothing is said to the offenders.) Their culture is unique and can be highly conservative, but overall they are quite attuned to the ways, customs, events, media, and manners of the world.\n\nLocal men usually wear a \"Kandoura\", a long robe (typically white), and ghutra, a red-checked or white headdress. Local women wear a black robe-like garment (abaya) and a black head scarf (shayla).\n\nThe UAE is more conservative than most Western societies, though not as much as some of its neighbors. Travelers should be aware and respect the more traditional outlook in the UAE, as there are behaviors typical in the West (for example, making \"rude and insulting gestures\") that will result in arrest in the UAE. On the other hand, Western travelers will find most of the UAE quite comfortable.\n\nAlthough women are not legally required to wear the ",{"type":"''","value":["hijab"]},", revealing fashions such as tank tops and shorts should be avoided. Below-the-knee skirts are somewhat more acceptable, although you will still incur stares. However, there are quite a few tourist or expatriate-dominated zones where even \"provocative\" dress may be seen, although not necessary respected. These include many areas of the Emirate of Dubai and, for example, beach resorts in Ajman or Fujairah. Public nudity anywhere is strictly forbidden and will be punished. Sharjah is the most conservative of the Emirates with public decency statutes (i.e., forbidding overly revealing clothing or certain kinds of beach wear), but few of them are enforced (although that varies). \n\nThe Emirates are not gay-friendly, and consensual homosexual activity is potentially subject to the death penalty. However, discretion is the key: like many things in Emirati society, what happens behind closed doors is - well - what happens. On the other hand, it is not uncommon for Emirati men or women to show physical affection but not across gender—Emirati men often kiss one another's noses in greeting and women greet one another with cheek kisses and may hold hands or link arms.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nThere can be heavy penalties for homosexuality, so gay and lesbian tourists should be very discreet.\n\nSex outside marriage is also illegal. Even women reporting rape have been jailed for adultery ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.theaustralian.com.au\/travel\/news\/rape-victim-alicia-gali-given-green-light-to-sue-the-commonwealth-of-australia\/story-e6frg8ro-1226071557257"]}," or sex outside marriage ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-23381448"]},". Caution is definitely indicated. \n\nThere are a couple of things you should be aware of to do with drug laws in the UAE. Some common painkillers in western countries are illegal narcotics in the UAE like codeine. Don't bring any with you unless you carry a copy of your prescription or you may join others who have received jail sentences. In contrast, antibiotics are freely available over the counter at pharmacies. If you receive a prescription for controlled drugs in the UAE, such as some painkillers and antidepressants, be sure to keep the copy of the prescription with you when traveling out of the country.\n\nAnother trap for the unwary is that if you are suspected of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, a blood test can be taken, and if it shows evidence of substances that are illegal in the UAE, then you will probably end up in jail even if the substances were ingested in the country that you were previously in. In addition to testing your blood, they will likely check your belongings. People have been jailed for possession for finding microscopic specks of drugs on them with highly sensitive equipment.\n\nAnother cause for concern is the very high rate of automobile accidents: besides due care while driving a vehicle, crossing the road on foot can be quite dangerous as well.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nGeneral medical care in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah is quite good, with clinics for general and specialized care widely available, including some which are now open 24 h. Hospitals in the major centers are well-equipped to deal with any medical emergencies. There is an ambulance system in all major population centres; however, coverage can be patchy in the more remote areas. Ambulances are designed for transportation rather than providing care as first responders, so don't expect top-flight on-site care. \n\nThe main government hospital in Abu Dhabi is quite good; as is the Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, now managed by Cleveland Clinic.\n\nIn Dubai, the government hospitals are Rashid hospital, which has a new Trauma Centre and Dubai Hospital which are very good. Welcare Hospital  American Hospital Zulekha Hospital NMC Hospital, and Belhoul Hospital in the private sector all have a good reputation. The country is free of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["malaria"]]}," and prophylaxis is not needed. In Sharjah, the Kuwaiti (Goverrnment) Hospital accepts expatriates. The private hospitals in Sharjah are the Zahra hospital, Zulekha Hospital and Central Private Hospital. Prices including healthcare are generally cheaper in Sharjah and although all hospitals meet the Ministry of Health standards the Central Private Hospital and Zulekha Hospitals are considered more affordable.\n\nAl Ain is served by a number of modern hospitals and care centers: Tawam Hospital, now managed by John Hopkins, and host to the UAE University Faculty of Medicine and Health Science; Al Ain Hospital (also called Al Jimi Hospital as it is in the district of Al Jimi), now managed by the Vienna Medical University; and the private Oasis Hospital, previously known as Kennedy Hospital, which was founded and run by Christian missionaries, and which was the first hospital in the city.\n\nThe water is safe to drink in the UAE, although most people prefer bottled water for its taste. The food is clean and in most restaurants is served to Western standards, particularly in tourist areas; however, hygiene can be an issue in some establishments outside, particularly roadside stalls. That said, food poisoning does happen, so use your common sense! \n\nThe heat in summer can reach 50°C (122°F), so avoid outdoors activity at the height of the day and watch out for signs of heat stroke. Be sure to drink lots of water as dehydration happens easily in such heat. If travelling off road (most of the country is desert), ensure you carry sufficient water to allow you to walk to the road should vehicles become bogged.\n\nAlthough the UAE is somewhat more accommodating to handicapped travellers than other countries in the Mideast, it would nonetheless be a difficult country to navigate in a wheelchair. Curbs are high and there are few, if any, ramps or other accommodations. This includes an almost complete lack of handicapped-friendly bathrooms.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By phone"]},"\nThe country code is 971. The mobile phone network uses the GSM technology (as in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Africa"]]},") and use is widespread. The format for dialing is: +971-#-### ####, where  the first \"#\" designates the area code. Key area codes include Dubai (4), Sharjah (6) and Abu Dhabi (2). Calls to mobile phones use the operator's area codes: (50\/56) for Etisalat and (55) for Du. Like other countries, when dialing locally, \"00\" is used to access an international number (and followed by the country code) and \"0\" is used to access a national number (followed by the area code).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By internet"]},"\nInternet cafés are fairly common in the larger cities, and web censorship is at times odd, but rarely obtrusive. All websites in the Israeli domain .il are blocked. Not much is known of how to bypass this blocking for people who need to visit Israeli websites. Instant messaging and voice-over-IP services like Skype sometimes work. The government owned telecommunications operator blocks access to these services to varying degrees. The blocking does not always stop calls and may vary depending on the network used. It also appears to be able to block Skypeout calls whilst allowing Skype-Skype calls. Even if the services are not blocked, connection speed can be an issue. Most people use a VPN service to bypass local Internet restrictions. \n\nEtisalat and Du both provide USB Internet connections.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["24.4667"],["54.3667"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Middle East"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:United Arab Emirates"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:United Arab Emirates"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Middle East\/United Arab Emirates\/"]]}]
