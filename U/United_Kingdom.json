Although Britannia no longer rules the waves, it continues to be hugely influential in the wider world and is a popular destination for many travellers. The capital and largest city of the United Kingdom is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nGreat Britain, the largest island of the British Isles has been inhabited since at least the last ice age, more than 10,000 years ago. While little is known about the inhabitants of stone age Britain, the world famous monument of Stonehenge survives to this day as a testament to their legacy.\n\nWritten history of Britain is generally understood to have begun with the Roman occupation of much of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["England"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wales"]]},", as well as the southern part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scotland"]]}," as the province of ",{"type":"''","value":["Britannia"]},". During that period, the original inhabitants of Britain were a group of Celtic peoples known today as the Britons. Following the fall of the Roman garrison in Britain, the island was subsequently settled by waves of Germanic peoples, collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxons eventually drove the Britons to what is today Scotland, Wales, Ireland and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brittany"]]},", where their descendants remain to this day. The Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and Breton languages of today are known to be descended from the original language of the Britons, while modern-day English is descended from the Germanic languages spoken by the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nBritain eventually came to be ruled by separate kingdoms, with the Kingdom of England in the south, and the Kingdom of Scotland in the north. The formerly independent Wales was absorbed into the Kingdom of England by two acts of the English parliament in 1535 and 1542 respectively. For many years, the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland fought many wars for control over the whole of Great Britain. This was to come to an end in 1603 with the Union of the Crowns when the Scottish King James VI inherited the southern throne and styled himself King James I of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1707 the parliaments of England and Scotland (under English pressure) passed the Acts of Union of England and Scotland abolishing a separate Scottish Parliament, although significant support for Scottish independence remains to this day. Despite losing the 13 colonies that became the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"]]}," after being defeated in the American War of Independence in 1783, the UK recovered from this setback and continued to grow wealthy from trade and possessions in the East. In 1801, after both the British and Irish parliaments (under British pressure) passed the Acts of Union of Great Britain and Ireland, the enlarged kingdom became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (UK). Decisive victories over Napoleonic forces at the battles of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Trafalgar"]}," in 1805 and, ten years later, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Waterloo"]}," (in which Napoleon met his final defeat) cemented the UK's place as one of the dominant political and military powers in the world.\n\nDuring the next fifty years the UK grew, under Queen Victoria, into the major world power and eventually possessed the largest empire the world had ever seen. At its widest extent in the early 20th century, the British empire encompassed what is today, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Africa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Egypt"]]}," and numerous other colonies in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Asia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Africa"]]}," and the New World.\n\nThe United Kingdom and its allies were victorious during ",{"type":"'''","value":["World War I"]},", after which it gained many territories from the defeated Germany, Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. Among those territories include what is today ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samoa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Namibia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Israel"]]},". At its greatest extent, the British empire was known as the empire on which the sun never sets, as its colonies covered every single time zone.\n\nIrish nationalists resisted British rule, driven in part by Catholic–Protestant conflict. Eventually the United Kingdom agreed to grant self-government as the Irish Free State in 1922, with six of the northern counties without an overwhelmingly Catholic majority remaining part of the UK as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Ireland"]]},". The Irish Free State eventually severed all ties and became the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Republic of Ireland"]]}," in 1949.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["World War II"]}," became the turning point in the history of the British empire. The German Third Reich, under Adolf Hitler, ignored British ultimatums not to invade ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Poland"]]}," and the UK declared war. While the UK was victorious in the famous, aerial ",{"type":"'''","value":["Battle of Britain"]}," and was spared the fate of occupation by the ",{"type":"''","value":["Wehrmacht"]}," that befell its not-so-lucky neighbours of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belgium"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]},", the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netherlands"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Channel Islands"]]},", it was at a heavy cost with thousands of civilian casualties and that even saw the destruction of the House of Commons chamber of Parliament. In addition, the UK lost much of its prestige in its overseas colonies, as most of its troops were tied up defending Britain against the Germans, and was unable to defend many of its Asian colonies against the Japanese. Most notably, the garrisons at Hong Kong and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]},", which were considered to be impregnable fortresses by the British government and public, ignominiously fell to the Japanese. Even though the Axis powers of Germany and Japan were eventually defeated, with Britain and its allies emerging victorious from World War II, it sparked the beginning of the end of the British Empire. The UK no longer had the resources to maintain control over such a large empire and they had lost the respect of the local people in their colonies due to their defeats by the Japanese. This allowed independence movements to gain traction and the UK granted independence to its colonies one by one. The last colony with significant population and economic importance, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]},", was returned to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]}," in 1997, an event which many called the \"end of empire\".\n\nDespite having lost much of its power, the UK remains a major player in world politics and continues to exert its cultural influences throughout the world through institutions such as the BBC and the Commonwealth. The UK continues to hold a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council with the power of veto. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," continues to be one of the most important cities in the world and, together with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]},", is one of the world's most important financial centres. In addition, the UK also continues to be one of the world's major centres of higher education, being home to some of the world's most prestigious universities such as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["University of Oxford"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["University of Cambridge"]}," and attracts more international students than any other country in the world except the US.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Home nations"]},"\nGeographically, \"Great Britain\" (\"GB\") refers just to the largest island; that is, Scotland, England, and Wales together. Great Britain became part of the United Kingdom when the Irish and British parliaments merged in 1801 to form the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". This was changed to \"... and Northern Ireland\" when all but the six Northern Irish counties seceded from the Union in 1922 after a treaty granting Irish home rule. \"Britain\" is simply another name for the United Kingdom, and does include Northern Ireland, despite ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/digitaldiplomacy.fco.gov.uk\/en\/guidance\/content\/editorial\/style\/uk-britain common misconception otherwise"]},".\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Union Flag"]}," of the United Kingdom is popularly known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Union Jack"]},", even on land. It comprises the flags of Saint George of England, Saint Andrew of Scotland and the Saint Patrick's Cross of Ireland superimposed on each other. Within England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the flags of each nation are commonly used. The Saint Patrick's Cross flag is often seen on Saint Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland. Since the Republic of Ireland split from the UK though, Saint Patrick's Saltire is not used for Northern Ireland, as it represented the whole of the island of Ireland. A flag (known as the \"Ulster Banner\") was designed for Northern Ireland in the 1920s, which was based on the flag of Ulster (similar in appearance to the St. George's Cross flag of England) and includes a Red Hand of Ulster and a crown. Although the flag's official status ended with the dissolving of the province's devolved government in the early 1970s, it can still be seen in Northern Ireland, particularly among the Protestant community and on sporting occasions. As Wales was politically integrated into the English kingdom hundreds of years ago, its flag was not incorporated into the Union Jack. The flag features a red dragon on a green field.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Crown Dependencies"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Isle of Man"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Channel Islands"]}," are not strictly part of the UK, but rather are 'Crown Dependencies: they have their own democratic governments, laws and courts and are not part of the EU.

All Commonwealth countries are self-governing and some still have the same monarch as the UK as their head of state.

If you need to refer to someone's nationality, you can use the more precise \"English\", \"Northern Irish\", \"Welsh\" or \"Scottish\".  To play safe, you can ask someone from which part of the UK they are from.\n\nNon English nations can be particularly sensitive, and \"Scottish\", \"Northern Irish\", \"Irish\", \"Welsh\" or \"British\" can all be appropriate according to the political persuasion of the individual. Irish nationalists may avoid referring to Northern Ireland at all, referring instead to \"The Six Counties\" or \"The North\", or talk about \"Ireland\" as a whole. \"Northern Irish\" is less likely to offend, whereas referring to someone from Northern Ireland as \"British\" or as \"Irish\" can cause offence depending on a person's political ideology.\n\nWhile technically just a county of England, the issue of identity in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cornwall"]]}," is very sensitive among some people and it is best to refer to anyone you meet in Cornwall as Cornish.\n\nAs a visitor from outside the UK, you are unlikely to cause serious offence.

It has the original bicameral parliament: The lower house, known as the House of Commons, is popularly elected by the people and is responsible for proposing new laws. The upper house, known as the House of Lords, primarily scrutinises and amends bills proposed by the lower house. The House of Lords is not elected and consists of Hereditary Peers, whose membership is guaranteed by birth right, Life Peers, who are appointed to it by the Queen, and the Lords Spiritual, who are bishops of the Church of England. The Head of Government is the Prime Minister, who is usually the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons. It has a first-past-the post system divided into local constituencies. In practice, the Prime Minister wields the most authority in government, with the Queen being pretty much a figurehead, though all bills that have been passed in both houses of parliament require the Queen to grant royal assent (which in theory, she has the right to refuse) before they become law. There have generally been two dominant parties in British politics in recent times; the Labour party and the Conservative party, although the current government sees the Conservatives in coalition with the Liberal Democrats.\n\nAdditionally, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have their own elected bodies (the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly). These devolved governments have a First Minister and varying degrees of power over matters internal to that constituent country, including the passing of laws. For example, the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh exercises power and passes laws over almost every matter internal to Scotland. In the areas over which it has power, the UK government plays no role. As a result, institutions and systems can be radically different between the four constituent countries in the UK. England has no similar body of its own, with all government coming from Westminster.\n\nThere are also local government authorities responsible for services at a local level. Each constituency votes for a local MP (Member of Parliament) who then goes to sit in Parliament and debate and vote - whether they do or not is another matter.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Using maps and postcodes"]},"\nMost basic mapping in the United Kingdom is undertaken by the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk\/ Ordnance Survey of Great Britain"]}," (OSGB) and the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.osni.gov.uk\/ Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland"]},". The maps found in bookshops may be published directly by those organisations, or by private map publishers drawing on basic Ordnance Survey data.\n\nOne consequence of this for the traveller is the widespread use of Ordnance Survey grid references in guide books and other information sources. These are usually presented in the format of two capital letters followed by a 6 digit number (e.g., SU921206) and form a quick way of finding any location on a map. If using a GPS be sure to set it to the British National Grid (BNG) and the OSGB datum.\n\nThe Ordnance Survey's 1:50,000 or 1:25,000 scale maps are astonishingly detailed and show contour lines, public rights of way, and access land. For pursuits such as walking, they are practically indispensable, and in rural areas show individual farm buildings and (on the larger scale) field boundaries.\n\nAnother company, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.harveymaps.co.uk\/index.html Harvey Maps"]},", produces specialist maps for outdoor activities including walking, climbing and mountain biking. These are surveyed independently of OSGB although they use the same grid reference system. They cover only a selection of popular locations. They have some advantages over the OSGB maps: they are printed on waterproof material, they are scaled according to the requirements of the activity and location (up to 1:12500 for complex mountain areas), and they contain less distracting detail not relevant to the specific activities for which they are designed.\n\nThe UK is also covered by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.openstreetmap.org OpenStreetMap"]}," although coverage varies considerably.\n\nEvery postal address has a postcode, either a unique one or one shared with its immediate neighbours. British postcodes take the form ",{"type":"'''","value":["(AAnn nAA)"]},", where AA is 2 or 1 letters representing the town, city or geographic area immediately followed by a 1 or 2 digit number ",{"type":"''","value":["nn"]}," representing the district, a space, then one digit and 2 letters ",{"type":"''","value":["nAA"]}," which denotes about 30 delivery points. In built-up areas this will be part of a road and even a specific section or floor of a building on that road.  Therefore, a postcode will identify a location to within a few tens of metres in urban locations; and adding a house number will usually identify a property uniquely (at road junctions two houses with the same number may share the same postcode).  Most internet mapping services enable locations to be found by postcode.  Owing to London's huge size and population it has its own distinct variation of the postcode system where the town code AA is replaced by an area code indicating the geographic part of the city - e.g. N=North, WC=West Central, EC=East Central, SW=South West; and so on.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe UK has a benign humid-temperate climate moderated by the North Atlantic current and the country's proximity to the sea. Warm, damp summers and mild winters provide temperatures pleasant enough to engage in outdoor activities all year round. Having said that, the weather in the UK can be changeable and conditions are often windy and wet. British rain is world renowned, but in practice it rarely rains more than two or three hours at a time and often parts of the country stay dry for many weeks at a time, especially in the East. More common are overcast or partly cloudy skies. It is a good idea to be prepared for a change of weather when going out; a jumper and a raincoat usually suffice when it is not winter. In summer temperatures can reach 30º in parts and in winter temperatures may be mild, i.e. 10º in southern Britain and -10º in Scotland.\n\nBecause the UK stretches nearly a thousand kilometres from end to end, temperatures can vary quite considerably between north and south. Differences in rainfall are also pronounced between the drier east and wetter west. Scotland and north-western England (particularly the Lake District) are often rainy and cold.  Alpine conditions with heavy snowfall are common in the mountains of northern Scotland during the winter.   The north-east and Midlands are also cool, though with less rainfall. The south-east and east Anglia are generally warm and dry, and the south-west warm but often wet. Wales and Northern Ireland tend to experience cool to mild temperatures and moderate rainfall, while the hills of Wales occasionally experience heavy snowfall. Even though the highest land in the UK rarely reaches more than 1300 metres, the effect of height on rainfall and temperature is great.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Units of measure "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["See also"],["Metric and Imperial equivalents"]]},"\n\nThe United Kingdom is the country of origin of the old imperial system, from which the current United States customary units are derived (though note that the American Revolution took place some 40 years before Britain standardised its weights and measures, with the result that British pints and gallons are 25% larger than their US equivalents). In official usage, the UK is in a curious state of partial metrication, with the use of the imperial system in some contexts, and the metric system in others. Temperature is nowadays measured using the metric system, with weather forecasts being given in °C. Likewise, fuel is sold per litre at fuel stations. For retail purposes, prices are often quoted using both imperial and metric units (e.g., prices of fruit and vegetables are quoted both per kilogram and per pound). \n\nHowever, road signs by and large continue to use the old imperial system. This means that speeds are given in mph and distances are given in miles. Milk, beer and cider continue to be sold by the pint. Land size is also usually measured using imperial units, with land areas often quoted in acres, and land price quoted per square foot. People also have a tendency to quote their weight in stones and pounds, and their height in feet if asked.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bank (public) holidays"]},"\nEach country (and sometimes cities, such as Glasgow and Edinburgh) within the UK have a number of (slightly differing) public holidays, on which the majority of people do not work.

Customs laws are therefore strict for the importing of alcohol and tobacco for non-personal use and if a Customs officer thinks that the amount you are trying to bring into the country from the EU is excessive, particularly if in a commercial vehicle as opposed to a private car, you may be questioned further, or be asked to prove that it is for your own consumption, although ultimately an EU citizen is backed by the EU's free trade laws and allowed unlimited personal quantities. The fines can be severe, and you also run the risk of the goods (and the vehicle they are being transported in) being confiscated. Importing an excessive amount of alcohol in a private car is more likely to result in action being taken for overloading the vehicle, which is a police matter rather than a customs matter.\n\nMost ports of entry that receive traffic from non-EU origins use the European Union's red\/green\/blue channel system.

Train travel is very popular in Britain, with many services busy and passenger numbers rising steadily every year. A mixed system is operated, with infrastructure being state-owned while commercial franchises operate trains, to a destination and service pattern specified by the government. \n\nIn Northern Ireland there is a state-owned system called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Northern Ireland Railways"]}," (NIR) which is separate and uses a different track gauge (the Irish gauge). For more details on rail travel in Northern Ireland, see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rail travel in Ireland"]]},"; the remainder of this section will focus on rail travel in England, Scotland and Wales (i.e. the island of Great Britain).\n\nWhile criticised by some as inefficient and there are issues such as overcrowding at peak times, the train is an effective and enjoyable way to explore Britain and get around places of interest. It is also by far the best option for inter-city travel, with most inter-city trains travelling at 200 km\/h (125 mph) and stations in most cities and towns being in the city-centre. Regional services travel up to 160 km\/h (100 mph). While this means that services are not as fast as the high-speed lines of France, Germany or Japan, there is a relatively high standard of service on both main and secondary routes. \n\nIn recent years the privatised system has been accused of many failings and there are frequent calls to re-nationalise the entire network, but today most train companies offer a good service, particularly on inter-city and mainline routes, though punctuality varies considerably. Despite the large number of companies, for the traveller the experience is remarkably well-integrated. Tickets can be bought from any one station to any other in Great Britain, no matter how far away, how many train companies or changes of train are needed to get there. However, you’ll find tickets cost less the further in advance you book – if you buy a ticket at the station on the day of travel, fares can be shockingly high (and surprisingly low if you book a few weeks in advance). \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Structure"]},"\nThe track, stations and infrastructure (with the exception of preserved railways) belongs to the state-owned ",{"type":"'''","value":["Network Rail"]},".

These are released for sale in limited numbers approximately 12 weeks in advance, and can only be used on the train specified on the reservation. If you travel on any other train or the wrong train, you will be charged an expensive full-price ticket or a penalty fare or else thrown off at the next station.

Parking is a problem in large cities, and especially in London, can be very expensive. Visiting smaller towns can often be done via the rail network, although driving may be a good option for more remote destinations. Fuel is heavily taxed and therefore expensive, currently at around ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.theaa.com\/motoring_advice\/fuel\/ £1.34 per litre"]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["(around US$2.05 per litre, or US$7.76 per gallon)"]},".

Supermarket branches of Tesco, Sainsburys, Morrisons and Asda often have ",{"type":"<","value":["abbr",{"title":"filling stations or gas stations"},["'petrol stations'"]]}," in their car parks which are often cheaper than the big name brands. \n\nLike in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"],["US"]]},", but unlike the rest of the world, the UK continues to use the imperial system for road signs and speed limits are indicated in miles per hour (mph). However, many height and width signs are now in metric as well and all weight signs are in tonnes; all motorways now have locator indicators in kilometres. If you are bringing your car in from the Republic of Ireland or from Continental Europe, then be sure to know the conversions from metric to imperial units (1 mile is about 1.6km).\n\nThere are no tolls with the exception of a few large bridges and tunnels and one ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.m6toll.co.uk\/ privately financed motorway in the Midlands"]},". There is a congestion charge of £8 per day to drive in central London. \n\nTraffic can be very heavy, especially during 'rush hour', when commuters are on their way to and from work - typically 07:00-10:00 and 16:00-19:00. School holidays can make a noticeable reduction in traffic, particularly in the morning rush hour. \n\nThe M25 London orbital motorway is notorious for having bad traffic (known to most Londoners as London's car park because sometimes all the traffic comes to a standstill) - it is best avoided on Monday mornings and Friday afternoons, use it only if you need to, and take local advice if you plan to drive to Heathrow to catch a plane. The M6 through Birmingham is another traffic blackspot as well as the M8 in Glasgow (the second most congested motorway after the M25). You can typically bet on finding a traffic jam if you drive for more than 90 minutes on the motorway system, especially as you approach cities. Checking local traffic reports on the radio or websites such as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.highways.gov.uk\/ Highways Agency"]}," or ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.frixo.com\/ Frixo"]}," can help if you know you need to travel during busy hours.\n\nMany cities operate a \"Park and Ride\" scheme, with car parks on the edge of the city and cheap buses into the city centre, and you should consider using them. In major cities (particularly London, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Birmingham) it is usually a much better option to park on the outskirts and take public transport to the centre. This not only saves money on parking and fuel but also saves a lot of time as heavy traffic, baffling one way systems, and limited parking space cause long delays. \n\nParking on-street is usually heavily restricted. Never park on a white, double yellow or double red line (stopping on white or red lines is illegal. Parking on a single-yellow line is restricted (typically no-parking during the daytime e.g. 07:00-19:00) and the restrictions are displayed on roadside yellow signs. Many residential streets require a resident's parking permit to park on the street, although outer-suburbs have less restrictions. On-street parking in cities may be restricted to disability-badge holders or be heavily metered, and is often for no more than a 1–2h stay in the daytime but is often free at night. Surface car parks generally operate the pay 'n' display payment system - you must buy a ticket from a vending machine, select how many hours you wish to pay and then place the ticket on your dashboard in clear view - these places are regularly patrolled and if you don't return to your car before the allotted time you'll get a penalty or get wheel-clamped. Often you'll need to enter the numeric digits from your car's number plate when buying the ticket to prevent people from 'selling on' tickets with leftover time. Multi-storeys are usually multi-level buildings or in larger cities may be located underground. Most have barrier-controls - you'll be issued with a ticket upon entry. When returning to your vehicle you must either pay at a 'pay station' (a self-service terminal inside the car park's lobby) in which you insert the ticket and pay the required amount - the ticket will be given back to you and you must insert it into the slot at the exit barrier; or alternatively you will pay a cashier at the exit barrier - it'll normally explain the payment process on the ticket. Parking charges vary from less than 50p per hour in small towns to over £4 an hour in the largest cities. Many larger cities have digital displays on the approach roads indicating how many parking spaces are available in each car park.\n\nIn any town, expect regular bus services between the centre, suburbs and nearby villages, and less frequent services to more rural areas. London also has the largest mass-transit system in the world - the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London Underground"]]}," and an extensive overground system and bus network too. London, Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, Nottingham and Blackpool have trams covering parts of those cities. Outside of London, Liverpool has the most extensive metro system (Merseyrail), spanning from several stations in the city centre to those in the outer suburbs. Newcastle has a similar network. Greater Manchester also has an extensive local train network in addition to its expanding 'Metrolink' tram system. Glasgow has a small underground rail system in the centre and a local train network. In some cities buses can be slow moving due to traffic congestion.\n\nThe UK has a comprehensive system of road numbers. These generally take precedence on signs: British roads are signed on a route-based rather than destination oriented basis. Therefore, before setting out on a long journey, plan the route you are going to take and note the road numbers you will need to follow. It is very unusual to see destinations, signed more than about 50 miles (80km) in advance. Other than that, UK road signs are excellent and should be very easy to follow. Road numbers are indicated by a letter and a number as in the rest of Europe and sign colours and letters are generally the same as on the rest of European routes, whilst allocated, are unsigned.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Motorways (prefix 'M'- blue signs, white route numbers)"]}," are fast, long distance routes that connect the major cities. The speed limit is 70 mph (115km\/h) for cars (lower for other types of vehicle) and certain vehicles, such as pedestrians, cyclists and those operated by learner drivers are prohibited. Junctions are numbered. The motorways are the best means of travelling long distances by car, but expect delays at peak times or in poor weather.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Primary roads (prefix 'A' - green signs, yellow road numbers)"]}," connect large towns with each other and with the motorway network.

The use of 20 mph ",{"type":"''","value":["(30km\/h)"]}," zones has become increasingly common to improve safety in areas such as those around schools.  Although national limits still technically apply to minor roads and back lanes, driving for the conditions is strongly recommended.\n\nSpeed cameras are widespread on all types of road, though more used in some areas than others (England's largest county, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Yorkshire"]]},", for example, has a policy of using no fixed enforcement cameras on its highways). Static cameras are often well signed, painted bright colours with clear markings on the road. While this might seem rather strange, the idea is to improve their public acceptance as a 'safety' measure (rather than the widely held opinion that they're there to collect money).  \n\nThere are some variable mandatory speed limits on the M25 to the west of London (enforced by cameras, again), and the M42 near Birmingham - these are shown on overhead gantries inside a red circle; other temporary speed limits shown on matrix boards are recommended but not mandatory. Apart from these and around roadworks, the motorways are generally free of fixed speed cameras. Speeds on motorways are generally much higher than the stated speed limit (usually at least 80 mph (130km\/h). Driving at slower speeds in the outside (overtaking lane) may cause frustration to other drivers.\n\nDriving standards are relatively well-maintained in the UK, with the road system being (statistically) among the safest in Europe. It has long been known by visitors that a foreign licence plate makes you largely immune from speed cameras, congestion charge cameras and Traffic (Parking) Wardens. If you choose to take your chances, be aware you may just hit upon the one Camera Operator\/Warden who can be bothered to take the trouble to track down your address from your home licensing authority. British authorities have access to vehicle registration databases from various other countries. Also, British hire car companies will charge traffic fines to your credit card, long after you have left the country. Traffic police patrol the motorways in marked and unmarked cars. Any police officers, regardless of their normal duties, will pursue a vehicle seen driving dangerously.\n\nDon't drink and drive in the UK. Although the maximum limit is  80mg of alcohol per 100mL of blood (0.08%), police in the UK have been known to 'pull' drivers who are technically below this, especially if their driving is erratic or dangerous.\nGoing 'over the limit' is a criminal offence; you will be arrested and spend a night in the cells. The police often patrol roads in cities and town centres on Friday and Saturday night, on the lookout for drink drivers. Enforcement of drink driving laws are extremely strict and police will always take action on those failing a breath test or those refusing to take one. Fines are up to £5,000; the minimum driving ban is 12 months for a first offence. As well as a 6 months prison sentence for being over the limit, additional penalties may be imposed if the driving was dangerous.\n\nDrivers from abroad should take note that many British drivers regard the flashing of headlights as a signal that ",{"type":"'''","value":["they can proceed"]},", rather than as a warning, or as a signal to slow down due to the presence of police. This misunderstanding has led to a number of collisions.\n\nIn a dangerous situation, where there is a risk of death or injury, sound your horn, even during the night. The inappropriate use of the horn is illegal between 23:00 and 07:30, or when stationary.\n\nIt is also an offence to use your mobile phone or any other handheld device whilst driving, although provision is made for the use of hands-free telephone equipment which is exempt from the law. Police will stop you for using your mobile phone and a £60 penalty will be issued on the spot. This fine will be accompanied with 3 points endorsed on your licence. \n\nAll vehicle occupants are required by law to wear a seat belt. Persons not wearing a seat belt may receive a £30 fine, although this does not come with any points. If a child under the age of 14 is not correctly restrained, the parent or guardian, normally the driver, is responsible and a fine will be issued for that offence also. Children under 1.4m and under 12 years of age are also legally required to use a child booster seat for safety reasons. It is illegal to put a rear-facing baby seat on the front seat with an active airbag. If possible, babies should always have their seats installed in the rear of the car. If there is so much cargo that a baby seat has to be put on the front seat, the passenger front airbag should be turned off. Turn it on again if you carry an adult passenger in the front seat afterwards.\n\nUse of fog lights where there is no fog is also an offence for which you may receive a £30 fine.\n\nThe road rules differ from other countries: side roads never have priority, there is no requirement to stop for school buses, overtaking on the left is illegal, and you may not turn left over a red light. There are no 4 way stop junctions in the UK; priority should be clearly marked on the road.  \n\nThere are lots of roundabouts (circular) across the UK, from large multi-lane roundabouts at dual carriageway junctions to small mini-roundabouts on local streets. The rules for entering them are the same - you have priority over traffic that has not yet entered it, and you must give way to anybody already on the roundabout (who would collide with your right side if you entered it). Be careful of two lane roundabouts, there are complicated rules for which lane you should be in which UK drivers learn and expect other drivers to follow. You should be fine provided you're cautious and keep an eye on other traffic. Some roundabouts are arranged in such designs and quick sequence that they can make you dizzy. Take it easy until you get used to it.\n\n\n\n\nFor further information on driving in the UK, consult the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.direct.gov.uk\/en\/TravelAndTransport\/Highwaycode\/index.htm Highway Code"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By campervan"]},"\nHiring a Campervan is one way to explore the UK.

Rural bus services are in general better than in France and the USA, but not as good as in Italy or Germany. Services range from deep-rural village services operating once a week or less, to intensive urban routes operating every few minutes. All communities except the very smallest villages have some kind of bus service. All buses in the UK are required to display the route number and destination clearly on the front. Almost all are \"one person operation\", i.e. there is no conductor and you must pay the driver as you board. The vast majority of bus stops are \"request stops\", meaning that you must put your arm out as the bus approaches to signal that you want it to stop. Likewise once on the bus, you must ring the bell in advance of the stop you want to get off at.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["London"]},"\nIn London, the iconic red buses cover the entire city, with most routes running at high frequencies from early morning until late night, and some operate 24\/7. Service frequencies are such that timetables are generally unnecessary for daytime travel. Comprehensive route maps are available from a variety of outlets and the Transport for London website, and stop-specific maps and timetables are displayed clearly at most bus stops. Buses are modern and highly specified, and are \"low floor\" offering easy access for wheelchairs, buggies and the elderly. Walk-up cash fares can be relatively expensive, but all-day and longer period tickets (including combined bus, rail and tube options) are available, offering excellent value. For travelling in London, the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/ Transport for London website"]}," is an incredibly useful website with a journey planner with maps, all fares, information on planned engineering works (there are plenty of those on the weekend) as well as live updates.

Therefore, co-ordination of services with each other and with rail services can be poor, and tickets often not inter-available. Return tickets are usually much cheaper than two singles, and most operators offer discounted fares for children. Most operators offer day or longer period tickets valid across their own network which can represent very good value, giving all-day travel for as little as £4, but are of little use if you need to use more than one operator. However, combined day tickets valid across more than one operator's network are also available in some areas. Weekday daytime services are frequent and comprehensive in many areas, particularly larger towns and cities. However, almost universally, service levels reduce sharply in the evenings and on Sundays. In the larger cities, for example Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh, an extensive night bus network is available.\n\nIn areas with a multitude of  operators, obtaining comprehensive map\/timetable information for the area can be difficult. It is not uncommon for operators to attempt to pass off their services as being 'the' network for the town or area in their publicity material - making no mention of the fact that other routes (or in some cases alternative departure times on the same routes) are available, operated by competitors. Many local authorities do attempt to produce comprehensive timetables and\/or maps for all services in their area regardless of who operates them - these are well worth obtaining and are commonly available from Tourist Information Centres. However it is still worth checking with the operator(s) before travelling to ensure that the information is up to date, as timetables can change frequently.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Coach"]},"\nCoach travel tends to be slower than train travel, as well as less frequent, although it is comfortable and often much cheaper.

In major cities, custom-built vehicles which seat 5 people are commonly used as metered taxis, but in smaller cities regular cars or people-carriers are used instead. These taxis can be hailed on the street or picked up from a taxi rank (usually found near major shopping areas and transport hubs). The rate varies, typically starting at around £2-3 and rising at around £1 a mile, making them fairly expensive. Add night charges, waiting charges, luggage charges for large suitcases etc. on to the meter as well, and travelling by taxi can be expensive unless you are in a large group. A short 10 minute trip would normally cost between £3-5. The 'Taxi' sign on the roof is illuminated when a taxi is available.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Minicabs"]},"\nMore common in suburbs and smaller towns, minicabs can only be used by telephone ordering and charge fixed prices to different destinations. Local telephone directories usually advertise taxi companies, and the phone numbers are usually painted in big numbers on the side of their vehicles. Minicabs are usually much cheaper, fares for long journeys can often be negotiated (although you should agree the fare with the phone operator when booking, not with the driver) and most companies have a variety of vehicle sizes from small saloons (Ford Mondeo, Skoda Octavia, Peugeot 406 etc.) up to large 12-seater minivans so if you have a large group you can specify the vehicle size.

If approached by a taxi driver claiming that you booked their taxi (particularly in airports or nightlife districts), ask them to confirm your name and phone number - if they don't know then it is most likely that they are fake.\nMost local councils require licensed taxis to be newer than 10 or 15 years old.

There are also routes from Northern Ireland to Birkenhead and Fleetwood (both near Liverpool in England).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By thumb"]},"\nPedestrians are banned on motorways, motorway junctions, as well as on certain primary routes.  However, aside from those exceptions, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["hitchhiking"]]}," is not illegal. The British are very aware of safety, and you may expect a long wait for a ride.\n\nIf you use signs, it's fairly customary to use the number of the road on them rather than the destination. In other words, from Birmingham to London you wouldn't use a sign \"LONDON\" but  rather \"M25\". Two places where signs are quite useful are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Land's End"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["John O'Groats"]]},", the two extremes of the country, especially if your sign says the other.\n\nNote that traffic in more remote areas of Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall can be quite scarce.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nThe UK can be both a cyclist's dream and nightmare. Fortunately cycling is popular as both a sport and a means of transportation. Bike rental exists in some cities e.g. Cambridge or Oxford and in some scenic areas. \n\nThe Barclays Cycle Hire scheme provides a network of approximately 8,000 bicycles and 570 docking stations across central London, covering an area from White City in the west to Docklands in the east. The scheme is available to walk-up users and charges a daily fee (currently £1, paid by credit or debit card) and, for journeys exceeding 30 minutes, a per-use fee is also charged. Between journeys, users are expected to return their bicycle to a docking station, taking another bicycle for subsequent journeys; the bicycles do not have locks, and journeys of under 30 minutes do not incur a per-use fee. It can be difficult to find bicycles (or spaces at docking stations, in the evenings) at the major rail termini during peak hours, as the scheme is popular with commuters. As well as on each docking station, cycle\/dock availability and maps are available online. Should your intended docking station be full, you can request up to 15 minutes additional time free of charge.\n\nThe wheels of choice for most British cyclists is the hybrid bike - they have the comfort and practicality of a city bike combined with the performance (multi-speed gearing) and ruggedness of a mountain bike. Conventional mountain bikes and single-speed roadsters are also common, and folding bikes are becoming more popular in major cities. Bicycles are expensive in the UK - expect to pay £100 or more for a basic model. They are sold by individual manufacturer's dealers (e.g. Dawes, Raleigh, Giant), automobile product stores (e.g. Halfords), sport accessory stores (e.g. Decathlon) and through private bicycle retailers. Cheaper used bikes can be purchased online via websites such as eBay or may be advertised in newspapers, on notice-boards etc.\n\nUrban cycling varies city-to-city. Most cities have designated cycle-lanes although they are routinely ignored by drivers and are often shared with buses, motorcycles and taxis. Some major roads will have split-pavements for pedestrians and cyclists, whilst other times cyclists are expected to ride in the traffic. This can be dangerous if you're not a skilled cyclist and general traffic rules should be adhered to. It is advisable to wear a helmet, despite helmets not being required by law for cyclists of any age. It's a legal requirement to have a rear reflector, pedal reflectors and a bell, and front & rear lights must be used at night. Also many cyclists use standard arm-signals to alert motorists - if you are turning left or right you should raise your left or right arm respectively, and if you wish to stop then you should wave your left arm up and down. Cycling is banned on certain roads - all motorways and many primary (A) roads - a sign will indicate this. It is illegal to cycle on the pavement. This is punishable by a fine of up to £500.\n\nMost cities will have designated bike-parking areas with bicycle racks and are almost always free. Carry a good lock with you as bike-theft is common. Bicycles are permitted on SOME trains, depending on the operator. Commuter trains generally allow folding bicycles only, some regional trains may have a rack that can carry 2-3 bicycles, while many intercity trains have a baggage car that can hold many bikes. Check with the operator before-hand - bikes will almost always require a reservation: on some trains for free, some for a small charge (typically half the adult fare) whilst others will require a full-fare ticket. Reservations can be made over the phone (via National Rail or via the train operator), or at the station ticket office. Long-distance coaches also allow bicycles, although again they must be reserved and there may be a surcharge. Local city buses and regional buses don't allow full-size bikes but some operators may permit folding bicycles - you should check before hand. If a bus is quiet then it's often down to the driver's discretion. Rapid transit systems also have varying bicycle policies e.g. London Underground allows folding bicycles at all times and conventional bicycles outside of peak hours as long as the train isn't crowded. \n\nThe SUSTRANS Cycle Network is a series of paved and unpaved cycle tracks covering the whole country, passing through some spectacular scenery on the way. Their website (www.sustrans.co.uk) has a comprehensive cycle-map and most cycle-stores, tourist information centres and youth hostels also sell their maps.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Motorcycle"]},"\nMotorcycling is not a bad form of transport. It is good for navigating areas with bad traffic e.g. in Central London, where motorcyclists do not have to pay the congestion charge that cars have to pay. However, it is important to prioritise your safety - although motorcyclists make up a minority of road users, they make up the vast majority of deaths and serious injuries on Britain's roads.\n\nThe rider and pillion passenger on a motorbike are required by law to wear a motorbike helmet that is CE marked. It must be fastened securely. The only exemption to this law is for Sikh men, whose religion requires them to wear a turban - they would have to remove the turban to put on the helmet. If you wear eye protection (visor on helmet or motorbike goggles), which is recommended, the visor or goggles must be kitemarked. You should consider buying a helmet with ear defenders. It is advisable to wear motorbike boots and gloves, and also a leather jacket and leather trousers or jeans, as they can also prevent serious injuries in a crash.\n\nIt is illegal to carry more than one pillion passenger. If you wish to carry multiple passengers, use a sidecar. The pillion passenger is required by law to sit astride the motorbike on a proper seat.\n\nYou must not carry a pillion passenger or take your motorbike onto a motorway until you get a full licence. To get a motorbike licence, you must take and pass a test and be at least 17 years old. \n\nIt is important to make sure you can be seen both at night and at day, and from the sides as well as the front and rear. Wear a high-visibility jacket or fluorescent strips (during the day) and reflective strips (at night). A good idea is to wear a white or brightly coloured helmet. You can also dip your headlights, even in good daylight, to make you easier to see, but only light them fully at night.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["\"Two countries divided by a common language\""],["Speakers of American English will find some terms which differ in British English:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Biscuits - cookies"]},{"type":"*","value":["Cash machine\/cash point - ATM"]},{"type":"*","value":["Cinema - movie theatre"]},{"type":"*","value":["Chips - fries, which may be \"french fries\" or thick-cut traditional British chips"]},{"type":"*","value":["Crisps - potato chips"]},{"type":"*","value":["Fag - cigarette (only used colloquially)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Lift - elevator in building; the offer of a ride in car"]},{"type":"*","value":["Lorry - truck"]},{"type":"*","value":["Motorway - expressway or freeway"]},{"type":"*","value":["Nappy - diaper"]},{"type":"*","value":["Queue - line"]},{"type":"*","value":["Return ticket - round-trip ticket"]},{"type":"*","value":["Take-away (in ordering food) - to-go"]},{"type":"*","value":["Toilet or Loo - washroom\/restroom\/bathroom\/lavatory (a bathroom is where you have a bath\/shower, not where you relieve yourself in British English)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Torch - flashlight"]},"\nPlease see the article ",{"type":"[[","value":[["American and British English"]]}," for more words that differ across both versions."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["English"]}," is spoken throughout the United Kingdom, although there are parts of major cities where immigration has led to a variety of languages being spoken as well. The English spoken in the UK has several dialects, some of which may contain words which are unfamiliar to other English speakers. It is exceedingly common for a resident of the south and one of the north not to understand each other at first go; do not be afraid to ask someone to repeat themselves. Your best bet would be to ask someone under the age of 30 as elderly people may have thicker regional accents.  A trained ear can also distinguish the English spoken by someone from Northern Ireland as opposed to someone from the Republic of Ireland, or even pinpoint their origin to a particular town within a county, such as Leeds or Whitby.

The number of Welsh speakers has risen over the last few years partly due to the language's promotion in schools, but this bilingual population is still only around 30% of the total population of Wales. Government bodies whose area of responsibility covers Wales use bilingual documentation (English and Welsh) - for example, see the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dvla.gov.uk\/ website of the Swansea-based DVLA"]},".

It is rare to find a place where all adults have the same accent or dialect.\n\nThere's an old joke that the people of the US and the UK are \"divided by a common language\", and travellers from English-speaking countries outside the UK may have difficulty catching specific words where regional accents are strong, but still there should not be any major difficulties in communicating. The British are good at understanding English spoken in a foreign accent, and visitors who speak English as a second language need not fear making mistakes. You may just get a slightly blank look for a few seconds after the end of a sentence while they 'decode' it internally.  Most British people will not criticise or correct your language, although some are very keen to promote British usages over American ones when talking to non-native-speakers.\n\nA few examples of words that overseas visitors may not be familiar with:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Wee - small (Scotland, Northern Ireland, some northern English people), can also mean to urinate (England)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Loch - lake (Scotland)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Lough - lake (Northern Ireland)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Aye - yes (some parts of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and northern England)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Poke - ice cream served in a wafer cone (Northern Ireland); a paper bag, especially one containing chips or sweets (Scotland)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Downing Street - used to refer to the Government (similar to White House referring to the President of the United States)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Cymru (pronounced 'Cum-ree') - Wales (Wales)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Cockney rhyming slang is not a language but a collection of terms, some local and temporary, others so long-lasting that they are used by many people who don't realise that they are rhyming slang.

It is considered far less shocking to say taboo words like \"cunt\" or \"twat\" compared to in America, and can even be a term of endearment depending on the situation. Tourists should get used to hearing the word \"mate\" (and \"boss or \"bruv\" to a lesser extent in London) a lot which is used in informal interaction (frequently male only) between strangers and friends alike, and is something similar to calling someone \"buddy\" or \"pal\". The use of affectionate terms  between the sexes such as \"darling\", \"love\" or \"sweetheart\" (even, in parts of Cornwall, \"lover\") is common between strangers and is not meant in a sexist or patronising manner. Furthermore, British people are prone to apologising for even the smallest things, much to the amusement of some and can be considered perhaps rude to not do so. An example such as bumping into you will warrant a \"sorry\" and is really more like \"pardon\" or \"excuse me\".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["British Sign Language"]},", or ",{"type":"'''","value":["BSL"]},", is the UK's primary sign language.

On the other hand, users of French Sign language and related languages—notably ISL and American Sign Language—will not be able to understand BSL, as they differ markedly in syntax and vocabulary, and also use a one-handed manual alphabet.\n\nBritish students often study a European language in school although they tend not to learn past basic levels.

The Normans imposed the system of Feudalism on England, and the bulk of the population were made to work the land in service of their Norman lords. In order to consolidate this system during the 11th and 12th centuries, the Normans went on a building spree, raising castles to intimidate and dominate and churches to inspire and unite.

The size increases according to value. It's often best to avoid getting £50 notes. £50 notes are often refused by smaller establishments - they are unpopular because of the risk of forgery, and because of the amount of change one needs to give on receiving one. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bank of England"]}," notes are universally accepted throughout the whole of the UK. Three Scottish banks (",{"type":"'''","value":["Bank of Scotland"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Royal Bank of Scotland"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Clydesdale Bank"]},") and four Northern Irish banks (",{"type":"'''","value":["Bank of Ireland"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["First Trust Bank"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Danske Bank"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ulster Bank"]},") issue their own bank notes with their own designs. These notes mostly come in the same denominations as Bank of England notes, with additional £100 notes. They are sometimes viewed with suspicion in England and Wales. However, these notes can be exchanged for Bank of England notes at any bank for free. When leaving the UK, try to only have Bank of England notes with you, as others can be difficult to change outside the UK.\n\nYou may also hear the slang term ",{"type":"'''","value":["quid"]}," for pounds. It's both singular and plural; \"three quid\" means \"three pounds\". People often will just say 'pee' instead of pence. \"Fiver\" and \"Tenner\" are common slang for £5 and £10, respectively.\n\nOccasionally, you may have problems if you try to pay for a small purchase with a £20 banknote. Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes can also be hard to spend outside those areas (see above); and in some cases you can't pay with notes at all (buses, for instance, don't always accept them). When paying a bill (for example, in a restaurant or hotel), usually any reasonable method of payment will be accepted unless it's been made clear to you in advance. Sterling travellers cheques may be accepted, although it's best to ask first.\n\nLarger banks and post offices have ",{"type":"''","value":["bureaux de change"]}," (one of many instances of English borrowing terms from French) which will exchange most foreign currencies for pounds, and vice versa, although they tend to accept only foreign notes, not coins.  Travel agents and several department stores (such as Marks and Spencer) often have them too; and even small airports have at least one, although rates there are often poor.

Almost all of them will accept overseas debit or credit cards.  Traveller's cheques can be exchanged at most banks. Be aware: some non-bank ATMs (easily identified, sometimes kiosk-style units, as opposed to fixed units in walls, and often at petrol\/gas stations and convenience stores) charge a fixed fee for withdrawing money, and your home bank may as well. On average the cost is about £1.75 per withdrawal, but the machine will always inform you of this and allow you to cancel the transaction.\n\nWhen using any ATM, beware of fraud, which is becoming increasingly common. The fraud works either by 'skimming' your card (reading the details on it with a device attached to the ATM) or trapping it in the machine, and using a hidden camera to record your PIN as you enter it. Never use an ATM with a card slot which appears to have been tampered with, and always cover the key pad with your hand, wallet or purse when entering your PIN. If you find an ATM which seems to have been tampered with, or if it retains your card, report this at once to the bank which owns it and to the police.  For obvious reasons, ATMs inside bank branches are much less vulnerable to this kind of fraud than those outside.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Credit and Debit Cards"]},"\nVisa, MasterCard, Maestro and American Express are accepted by most shops and restaurants, although American Express is sometimes not accepted by smaller independent establishments, and it is worth asking if unsure, especially if there are long queues.  Internet purchases from a UK-based merchant with a credit card however cometimes incur a 2-2.5% surcharge (this does not apply to a debit card).  Since 14 Feb 2006, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.chipandpin.co.uk\/ Chip and PIN"]}," has become nearly compulsory, with few companies still accepting signatures when paying by credit or debit cards. Customers from countries without chips in their credit cards are supposed to be able to sign instead of providing a PIN; however, it is wise to carry enough cash in case the retailer doesn't comply.  \n\nAlthough most small shops will take cards, there is often a minimum amount you have to spend (usually around £5). Anything under the minimum and they may refuse to accept the card, or charge a fee to process the payment.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Costs"]},"\nThe high cost of basics such as transport, accommodation and food means that you will probably spend at least £50 per day as a budget traveller.

In many restaurants with table service, a 'service charge' on your bill replaces a tip; in the absence of a service charge, a tip of about 10-15% is customary. A tip of 10% is customary in metered taxis in the larger cities, although in rural taxis a fare is usually agreed in advance and it is rare to add a tip on top of the agreed fare.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cigarettes and tobacco"]},"\nCigarettes are heavily taxed; more than £7 for 20 cigarettes. 50g pouches of rolling tobacco are about £12. Imported brands such as Marlboro, Camel or Lucky Strike are generally the most expensive as are well-known UK brands such as Benson & Hedges and Embassy. Low-tar cigarettes cannot be called 'light' so terms such as 'gold' and 'smooth' are used. Most cigarettes come in low-tar and menthol variants, and many brands also sell 'Superking' (100mm length) variants too. The cheapest prices will be found in the supermarkets at the customer service counter. Almost all newsagents, supermarkets and petrol stations sell tobacco, and most will also sell some brands of pipe tobacco and cigars. For a more extensive selection of tobacco products, most towns and cities will have at least one specialist tobacconist. New laws now require that tobacco products are not displayed. \n\nThe minimum age to purchase tobacco is 18. However, smoking is legal at 16. Customers who appear younger than 18 (and, in some places, 21 or 25) may be asked to produce ID to prove they are aged 18 or over (passports, driving licences and cards bearing the PASS hologram are acceptable).\n\nIn some places there is a black market in considerably cheaper, imported cigarettes and you may be offered them in pubs by crims (rarely the publican or bar staff!) The health warning on these is likely to be in a language other than English. This is best avoided as this is an illegal trade.\n\nSmoking is illegal in all enclosed public places with the exception of some hotel rooms (enquire when booking). For the purposes of the anti-smoking law, 'enclosed' is defined as having a minimum of three walls and a roof, so this can include things such as 'open' bus shelters. It is also illegal to smoke at railway stations. Penalties can include a £50 'on-the-spot' fine. Most pubs and nightclubs have smoking areas which fully comply with the relevant legislation.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shopping"]},"\nAlthough shopping in the UK can be expensive, it is generally regarded as a world-class destination for shoppers both in terms of variety and quality of products, depending on where and what you buy. Fierce competition has brought prices down considerably in the food, clothing and electronic sectors. Prices do vary and it is always worth visiting the various retail stores as bargains can often be found. Avoid buying from the tourist areas and stick to the High Street shops or the many 'out-of-town' retail parks where prices will be considerably cheaper. The retail market in the UK is a very competitive one and many bargains are to be had all year round. In the electronics sector, for example, it is becoming more and more common to ask for a price reduction at time of purchase.\n\nVAT ('Value Added Tax' - a mandatory tax levied on most transactions in the UK) is 20% with reduced rates of 5% and 0% applying to specific categories (for example, electricity is taxed at 5% and uncooked food, children's clothes and books are taxed at 0%).

The internet is always a good way to judge the price of a particular item, also you can use this as a bargaining tool when agreeing on a price with some of the larger electronic retail stores. If visiting from the US, there may be duties and taxes charged that make some of these purchases much less of a bargain so shop wisely.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nDespite jokes and stereotypes, British food is actually very good and has improved greatly over the past few decades, and the British remain extremely proud of their native dishes. Restaurants and supermarkets in the middle and upper range have consistently high standards, and the choice of international dishes is among the best in Europe. However, British eating culture is still in the middle of a transition phase. Unlike their continental neighbours, many Britons still eat to live rather than living to eat, and as a result, food quality is variable at the budget end of the market. Moreover, as Britain is a culturally diverse nation, many different kinds of food are available due to the influence of immigration.\n\nThe United Kingdom can be an expensive place to eat out compared to, say, the more southern European countries, but relatively cheap in comparison with countries such as Switzerland and Norway.\n\nMany restaurants in city centres tend to be a little more expensive than ones in the suburbs, and pubs do tend to be slightly more expensive in the countryside, but generally, a three-course meal without drinks will cost the traveller anywhere between £10 and £25. Chicken tikka masala with rice is sometimes claimed as the UK's most popular dish, though roast beef is a more traditional national dish.\n\nIf all else fails decent picnic foods such as sandwiches, cakes, crisps, fresh fruit, cheeses and drinks are readily available at supermarkets. Street markets are a good place to pick up fresh fruit and local cheeses at bargain prices. Bakeries (e.g. Greggs) and supermarkets ( e.g. Tesco, Sainsburys, Waitrose, Morrisons and Asda) usually sell a good selection of pre-packed sandwiches, pasties and cakes along with a range of soft drinks, juices and mineral waters. In addition, most chemists and newsagents will have a basic supply of pre-packaged sandwiches and bottled drinks.   \n\nMany large shops, especially department stores, will have a coffee shop or restaurant.\n\nSmoking is now banned in ",{"type":"''","value":["all"]}," restaurants, cafés, bars and pubs - there are no exceptions. However some establishments have provided 'smoking areas' and smoking is allowed in the gardens\/terraces outside pubs and restaurants unless otherwise stated.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Fish and chips"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Flickr adactio 164930387--Fish and chips.jpg"],["thumb"],["Fish & Chips, a quintessentially British dish"]]},"\nDeep-fried, battered fish (usually cod or haddock, though with a wider selection in some areas) with rather thick chips, always made from real chunks of potato rather than thin tubes of extruded mashed potato. Fish and chips are often served with mushy peas (in England), and dressed with salt and malt vinegar (or 'Sauce' in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland). \"Proper\" (authentic, for-the-masses) fish and chips can be bought only from either a backstreet \"chippy\" or a specialist fish and chip restaurant (the latter are mostly at the seaside, although there is a national chain, Harry Ramsden's, which does quite good fish and chips, but at \"tourist prices\"; Mr Ramsden's original shop, near Leeds, was a legend). However, a \"proper chippy\" (a backstreet \"fish and chip shop\", or just \"chip shop\") is the quintessential place to buy fish and chips. In the north you can also add mushy peas to your order. These are rarer in the south of the country. In Scotland, especially Glasgow, some fish and chip shops deep-fry almost everything they sell, including meat pies, pizzas, and even battered Mars or Snickers bars. In Northern Ireland, you can also order a ",{"type":"''","value":["Pastie"]}," (not to be confused with a ",{"type":"''","value":["Cornish Pasty"]},"). This is meat minced with onions, potato and spices, which is then battered and deep fried. It can be served in a ",{"type":"''","value":["bap"]}," (a soft bread bun), on its own, or with chips. Anything served with chips in Northern Ireland and in parts of Scotland is referred to as a \"supper\", e.g., \"a fish supper\" or \"a pastie supper\".\n\nThe best ones are specialists, serving perhaps a few alternatives such as a selection of pies or sausages. They are usually located near where people live, though some good ones, especially \"sit down\" chippies, can be found in town centres. They can be spotted by the illuminated sign which usually has a picture of a fish and a name: either punning and piscine, such as \"Codroephenia\" and \"The Codfather\" or proud and proprietorial, \"Fred's Chippy\", or even both as in \"Jack's Golden Plaice\". Typically a lot of people eating or waiting is an indication of good food.\n\nA \"sit down chippy\" is a chip shop with a separate dining room. Whilst no real one will be exactly like this, although most elements will be present, a stereotypical sit down chippie will be brightly lit and decorated in a nautical theme with yellow or blue formica-topped tables. Typically a waitress will take your order for a Cod Meal, alternatively Haddock, Plaice or another dish, and within five minutes your meal will be served: a huge fish, a mountain of chips and mushy peas. Accompanying it, in more up-market places, will be a sachet of tartar sauce, a slice of lemon, a big plate of bread-and-butter, and a pot of tea. Some will have a separate pot of hot water, either to dilute the tea if it is too strong for your taste, or to \"top-up\" the tea in the pot when you have poured out your first cup. On the table will be a large shaker of salt and a bottle or plastic squeezy bottle of brown malt vinegar, which is what most British will put on their fish and chips. There may even be a tomato-shaped plastic container of ketchup or a container of ",{"type":"''","value":["brown sauce"]},". Fish and chips bought from a pub, hotel or non-specialist restaurant bear little resemblance to those from a chippy.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Take-aways"]},"\nA 'take-away' is either a shop supplying prepared meals for people to eat elsewhere, or the meal itself. A very British take-away is the Fish and Chip shop; the sandwich shop is a popular choice at lunchtimes; they often also sell pies and cakes.  Alternatively, most towns and many main routes have a selection of fast-food chains. Various types of take-aways are present in nearly all towns, ranging from fish and chips to \"Indian\", which can often be operated by non-Indians like Bangladeshi, and Chinese shops.  Thai and Indonesian takeaways are becoming quite common, and lots of others in bigger towns.  Generally the standard of take-aways is good, but the best guide is, as always, to observe what the locals are doing.\n\nIn towns and cities these places tend to open late (sometimes until about 01:00) to cater for the so-called after-the-pub crowd. At this time they tend to be busy and rowdy so, to avoid the queues the best time for a takeaway may be 19:00-23:00: after the teatime rush but before the supper crowds. Takeaways in larger city centres may stay open until 03:00 or 04:00 to cater for people coming out of nightclubs; typically these will be independent kebab shops and chippies, as well as some fast food chains such as Domino's and Subway. This isn't to be expected outside large cities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Food in pubs"]},"\n\nSee below for general points about pubs. Pubs are typically places where you can sample British cuisine. There is no such thing as a British restaurant ",{"type":"''","value":["per se"]},", so these will be your next best bet; even if you are against drinking alcohol, you will find a more traditional and full menu than a cafe or chippy.\n\nAlmost all pubs (see below) serve food, although not all will do so during the whole of their opening hours.  Prices of all these types vary enormously, and you should seek local advice if you have particular requirements or standards. Do not sit at a table in a pub expecting a waiter to take your order for food or drinks: pubs nearly always work on a \"queue at the bar for drinks: order at the bar for food\" basis. You go to the bar to request and pay for drinks and food.  To avoid annoying customers behind them, groups usually order as one, and \"settle up\" between themselves later (see elsewhere for \"buying rounds\").  You normally order your \"starters\" and \"mains\" together (food-oriented places have numbers screwed to the tables for you to quote, or will give you a number to take to your table). There is an etiquette that if you see another patron at the bar, you should invite them to order first. You then wait for your drinks to be poured and carry them to the table.  When your meal is ready, it is either brought to you or, less commonly now, announced when it is ready for you to collect. The person who tidies away your main course may ask you what dessert you would like, or you may have to order at the bar again.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Restaurants"]},"\nLarger towns have a range of restaurants to suit most tastes and you will find a very broad range of cuisines, including Indian, Chinese, Thai, French and Italian. Waiters generally expect a 10% tip (but all too often do not get it from the native population) and in some places this is automatically listed on your bill. However, if you are dissatisfied with the service in any way, you are under no obligation to pay the service charge. Generally British people are not great tippers. As a visitor the 10% rule is more than generous and worth sticking to. Visitors from The US and Canada are seen as very generous tippers and even a bit of a soft touch by some.\n\nThe usual fast-food restaurants (McDonalds, Burger King, Pizza Hut, KFC, Subway and local chain Wimpy) are widespread in larger towns and cities but uncommon in smaller towns. They are typically located in major shopping areas, in or around major train stations, in out-of-town retail parks and in motorway service stations and airports (the latter 2 are usually more expensive). Prices are average - a burger, chips and drink meal will cost about £4-5. Most are open from around 07:00-22:00 although some in large cities are 24-hours. Fast-food restaurants in out-of-town locations offer drive-through service. Delivery service is widely offered. \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Curry"]},"\nOne of the most popular types of restaurant in the UK is the Indian restaurant. They can be found in every city and most towns large and small. There are now more and more upmarket Indian restaurants in the larger urban centres. Indian restaurants serve cuisine commonly known to their customers by the generic term \"curry\". Common Indian restaurant dishes include Chicken Tikka Masala, Prawn Biryani and the incredibly spicy Vindaloo. A popular version of curry is known as balti, possibly named after the metal bowl the food is cooked and served in. Balti cuisine, and a number of other commonly served dishes such as the ubiquitous chicken tikka masala, originated in the UK though it is clearly based on food from the Indian subcontinent. Birmingham in the Midlands is considered the balti capital of the UK as this dish was conceived there.

Most contain fast-food outlets and all have (free) toilets. Some services may be limited overnight such as the range of hot and cold food, although most will keep a selection available. Service areas are often best avoided as it is often possible to find cheaper and much better places to eat within a mile or two of a motorway junction. They have a poor reputation for hygiene and service; subsequently places like Little Chef have taken such a hit that many have closed.

If you are staying as a guest in a British home it would be considered courteous to inform your host beforehand as to any dietary requirements, but this will not be considered rude or even particularly unusual.  If you are staying in a B&B, let the owner know when you arrive, and you'll often find that they will cook up a special vegetarian breakfast for you.\n\nBear in mind that even if you call yourself vegetarian some people will assume you eat fish, so if you don't, then tell them so. Nowadays, it is rare to find a pub or restaurant with no vegetarian options.\n\nIf you are a vegan, be prepared to explain precisely what you do and don't eat on a fairly frequent basis. Outside of specialist eateries, most places probably won't have a vegan-friendly main meal, so be prepared to hunt around, order bits and bobs, or in a pub make do with the ubiquitous bowl of chips and tomato ketchup and even then it would be wise to check whether the chips have been cooked in animal fat, a practice quickly falling out of fashion.\n\nIn general, the best places for vegetarian and vegan food are specialist veggie pubs and restaurants and Indian, Chinese and South-East Asian restaurants.  Most major cities and towns will have at least one.  Expensive upscale restaurants may have more limited vegetarian options, and sometimes none at all.  If you're fortunate enough to be dining in such a place, it may be worth ringing ahead.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Children"]},"\nChildren are not necessarily allowed in all pubs and restaurants unless a lounge area is provided, and high chairs are not always available. Most pubs that serve food will accept children, and it is usually  easy to distinguish those that do. The general rule is that children cannot sit or stand about in the area where drinks are being served; so if the pub has only one small room, they are not allowed.

Nevertheless, if you're over 18 but lucky enough to look younger, expect to be asked to prove your age when buying alcohol (also, in certain places if you look under 21 or 25, you have to prove you're over 18, known as \"Challenge 21(25)\"), especially in popular city spots.  Some premises will require proof of age for all drinks after a certain time of night due to restrictions on the age of people who can be on the premises. The most trustworthy form of ID is a passport or driving licence which shows both your photograph and date of birth.  ID cards are likely to be accepted (providing there is a photograph) and proof of age cards are available which must be applied for by post and take several weeks to issue.  Any other form of ID willl not be accepted. In private residences the minimum age to drink alcohol is 5 years old, although it is likely that if a 5 or 6 year old etc. were getting drunk, the matter would be brought before the courts as child neglect. \n\nGetting drunk is acceptable and often it is the objective of a party, though the police often take a dim view on those causing alcohol-related trouble. This applies to all levels of the British society - it may be worth remembering that the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had to collect his son Euan from a police station after he had been found drunk celebrating the completion of his GCSE exams taken at the age of 16. Nevertheless, Britons have a great sense of humour and everything is forgotten after a hangover, at least until the next time. Drinking is an important part of the British culture and, even though it is frequently complained about, it is as popular as ever.\n\nUrinating in public is illegal, anti-social and quite difficult to explain when applying for a visa. You should try to use the facilities where you are drinking.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Pub"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:De beauvoir trolley stop.jpg"],["thumb"],["A traditional English pub"]]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["pub"]}," (or public house) is the most popular place to get a drink in the UK, though ",{"type":"''","value":["types"]}," of pubs can vary dramatically. They range from 'local' pubs, usually quiet places consisting of one or two rooms, to chain pubs such as J.D. Wetherspoons, which are very large rooms capable of holding hundreds of people. Even small villages will often have a pub, serving spirits, wines, beers, cider, 'alcopops' and non-alcoholic drinks, accompanied by crisps, nuts and pork scratchings. Many serve snacks or meals. The greater volume of drinks served are various kinds of beer, mainly lagers, bitters, and porter \/ stout (i.e. Guinness).  People not looking to drink ",{"type":"''","value":["real ale"]}," are free to choose a pub just on the basis of location, and character, because most national \"smooth\" bitters or TV-advertised lagers are available in any non-real-ale pub; however, even non-real-ale drinkers often find that they prefer the types of pubs with a range of real ales, because they tend to be more \"traditional\", with a more individual character and less oriented to juke boxes, games machines, fruit machines and large crowds. \n\nAcross the whole of the United Kingdom there is now a blanket ban on smoking inside pubs and restaurants, though many pubs have areas outside, often known as \"beer gardens\", where smoking is (usually, but not always) permissible. However if you are lucky (or unlucky) enough to be able to stay after the formal closing hours this is called a \"lock-in\" and smoking may be ok if the pub landlord allows it. This will often occur only in the later hours after 23:00 and these lock-ins can last any amount of time. As they are classed as a private party, they happen in only a few pubs, and often only pubs with more regular customers, although this is not always the case. Once at a lock-in, you cannot leave and come back in again.\n\nBritish ",{"type":"'''","value":["real ales"]},", championed by the Campaign for Real Ale ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.camra.org.uk\/ (CAMRA)"]},", are among the best in the world - though people used to colder, blander, fizzier beers may find that the taste needs to be acquired. People looking for real ale will need to select the right pubs, because although a wide range of pubs serve one or two real ales, only a \"real ale pub\" will have a wide selection. British ale has a limited shelf life compared to most foreign beers, and as some pubs have only a \"token\" cask with low turnover, it's often well past its prime and has a strange vinegary taste: often, unfortunately, people's first and understandably only experience with \"real ale\". If you do receive an 'off' pint, ask for a replacement at the bar, which will usually be forthcoming.\n\nThe phrase \"free house\" was usually the main indicator for people looking for a good choice of beer, because this indicated that the pub was not owned by a particular brewery and served whatever beer its landlord thought would appeal to their customers. However, this is no longer a significant factor, because most national pub chains are now owned by large conglomerates who deal centrally with brewers and serve the same mass-market brands in all their pubs: these conglomerates (not being breweries) can still call their pubs \"free houses\".\n\nBritish people usually follow a kind of unwritten code of conduct when in pubs.  It's a form of self-regulation and mutual respect in what can appear to be a busy and chaotic place, especially at weekends.  The main points to be aware of:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Don't sit down and wait for table service.  In almost all cases there won't be any.

However, you are not obliged to do this yourself.  If you're given only a small amount of change and you feel generous, there's often a charity collection tin on the bar you can use.

Recently there has been a trend, strongly resisted in some quarters,  towards chain-pubs such as the Hogshead, Slug and Lettuce and those owned by the JD Wetherspoon company. Another recent trend is the ",{"type":"'''''","value":["gastro pub"]},", a smartened-up traditional pub with a selection of high-quality food (nearly at restaurant prices).\n\nBeer in pubs is served in ",{"type":"'''","value":["pint"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["half-pint"]}," measures, or in bottles.  A pint is slightly more than half a litre (568mL to be precise). Simply ordering a beer on tap ('draught beer') will be interpreted as a request for a pint, e.g. 'a lager, please'.  Alternatively 'half a lager, please' will get you a half-pint. If you ask for a \"half-pint of lager\" in a noisy pub, you will almost certainly get a pint, because no-one asks for a \"half-pint\" and the bar person will have thought you said \"I'll have a pint of lager, please\".  Prices vary widely based on the city, the pub and the beer, but generally pints will be in the range £3 to £4. Note that bottled beers often cost almost the same, although they hold much less than a pint (330 mL being standard).\n\nSpirits and shorts are normally 25mL although some pubs use a standard 35mL measure, in all cases it will be clearly indicated on the optic, in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the standard measure is a 35mL measure. A ",{"type":"''","value":["dram"]}," in Scotland was traditionally a quarter of a gill measure now 25mL.\n\nWine in pubs generally comes in 125mL (small) or 175 mL (large) measures, although unless the pub specialises in wine it's often low quality.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Food in pubs"]}," can range from nothing except crisps and nuts, through basic 'pub food' (normally with chips) to restaurant-standard and beyond (a few pubs even have Michelin stars). Pubs that specialise in food often have a separate area set aside for eating. Food service often stops well before the pub closes, however. \n\nWhen applying for a licence, pubs can specify any opening times they wish; this can be challenged by neighbours, etc.  Closing times are typically the 'last order' time - the pub can sell drinks before this and customers have to drink up and leave within 20 minutes of the licensing hours.  The staff will normally call out 10 minutes before last orders and again when the bar closes.\n\nUntil the recent change in licensing laws, closing times were 23:00 and 22:30 on a Sunday, and this is still quite common. The most common closing times at the weekends in towns are between midnight and 01:00 and some larger pubs may apply for a licence until 02:00 and clubs 03:00 or 04:00. It is not unheard of that some bars have licences until the early hours (06:00) although this is rare as many who are out until this time are likely to go to nightclubs and then home. Theoretically, a pub can ask for a 24-hour licence, though few have done so.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Wine bars"]},"\n\nIn cities, in additional to traditional pubs, there are more modern ",{"type":"'''","value":["wine-bars"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["café-bars"]}," (often known simply as ",{"type":"'''","value":["bars"]},"), though the variable weather means that there is not as much of a 'street scene' as in other European cities. However, depending on the weather, there are more and more pavement cafés in the UK than in the past. Parts of London, Manchester and other up-and-coming cities are good examples of this change of scene.\n\nPrices in bars tend to be higher than in pubs, with less focus on beer, and more on wine, spirits and cocktails. Customers are often younger than those of traditional pubs, though there is much crossover and some bars are more \"pubby\" than others.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Clubbing"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Clubbing"]}," is popular in most large towns and cities, and many have world-renowned venues as well as many alternative venues. Great clubs can be found in London, Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Brighton to name just a few places. Prices in clubs tend to be considerably higher than those charged in pubs, and opening hours may not be the attraction they once were, as pubs can now open late too. Most clubs will not admit anyone under 18. ID may be asked for at the door, but ID checks at bars are less common. Dress codes are sometimes applied by doormen or bouncers before entry, sometimes none-too-consistently. Common dress codes are simply to dress smartly and avoid wearing sports wear, including trainers. However \"fashion\" trainers, especially dark coloured ones are increasingly accepted when part of smart attire. That said, some upmarket clubs will still insist on shoes and if in doubt, wear shoes to avoid being turned away.\n\nClubs are often cheaper during the week (Mon-Thu) as many of these nights are designed to cater for students; however, you usually have to pay an entrance fee. For a club in a small town (capacity 250-300) this will usually be £1-£2 on week night, £2-£3 on weekends, and seldom more than £5 on special occasions. Conventional clubs in bigger towns and alternative clubs in cities will cost anywhere between £5 and £10. Large clubs, especially those in cities, that cater for a \"dance\" crowd will almost certainly cost over £10, though seldom more than £15.

This includes volunteer work.\n\nThe UK has had low unemployment in recent years, making it easier for those with specialist skills to gain working visas. A general shortage of skilled labour in the health sector means the British health service actively recruits abroad, making it easier for those with specialist health care skills to work in the UK.  \n\nCitizens of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong (British National (Overseas) passport holders only), Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan (as well as British overseas citizens and British overseas territories citizens) can apply for a Tier 5 visa under the Youth Mobility Scheme, which lasts 2 years and permits the holder to work.\n\nYoung people of other nationalities may be able to work on internships in the UK by applying for a Tier 5 visa under the Government-sponsored exchange category.

A similar service is available in some parts of England at ",{"type":"'''","value":["111"]}," for health issues that do not require urgent A&E admission, and will be rolled out throughout the country during 2013.\n\nLate at night it is not uncommon to find rowdy groups of drunk people, especially young men, on the street, but unless you go out of your way to provoke trouble you are unlikely to experience any problems. The police have fairly wide ranging powers to fine or arrest people who are causing a disturbance, and although they can be heavier-handed in major cities they are generally tolerant. Drinking alcohol in public (except outside a bar or pub) is not permitted in some towns and areas of cities.\n\nJaywalking is not considered an offence, but always try to cross at designated pedestrian crossings. Most operate a \"Push the button and wait for the green man\" system, but some Zebra Crossings are still to be found - identified by white stripes on the road and yellow flashing spherical lights - pedestrians have right of way but it is advisable to make eye contact with the driver before stepping into the road. Some drivers will give a nod or wave to acknowledge you.\n\nIf you are bringing or hiring a car, be sure to lock the doors if you leave your car, and always park in a busy, well-lit area. Don't leave valuables on display in a parked car - satellite navigation systems are a particular target.\n\nThe age of both heterosexual and homosexual consent is 16 throughout the United Kingdom. Teenagers are generally seen as still children (except those 18 or over, but ",{"type":"'''","value":["always ask for proof of age, e.g. passport to prove someone's age, just to be safe."]},") and you could be termed a paedophile and treated as such. Homosexuality is generally accepted among people throughout the whole country. \n\nRacism is not common in the UK, and racially motivated violence is very rare. The main concern for Britons isn't racism; the government strongly encourages the notion of a multi-cultural society, but recent high levels of immigration have been of debate. However, the UK is generally regarded by its own immigrant population as being among the most liberal and tolerant of European countries in this respect, but obviously there will be some people who are exceptions. Most Britons will go out of their way to make tourists and immigrants feel welcome and it's not uncommon for courts to impose harsh punishments on any form of racial abuse - physical or verbal.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Police"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Police.three.on.patrol.london.arp.jpg"],["thumb"],["A group of UK police officers on patrol."]]}," On the whole, British police officers tend to be professional and trustworthy, and are generally less aggressive than law enforcement agencies in many other developed nations. However, this does not mean they are lenient. With local exceptions, such as airports and nuclear power plants, the vast majority of British police officers ",{"type":"'''","value":["do not carry firearms"]}," on standard patrol. \n\nMost officers will only speak English and you will be made to speak to an interpreter over police radio or will do so at a police station if you can't understand questioning in English. You have the legal right to silence when arrested. \n\nPolice officers in Great Britain wear dark blue uniforms. Police officers in Northern Ireland wear dark green uniforms and - unlike most of their colleagues in Great Britain - are always armed with a Glock semi-automatic pistol and sometimes larger weapons.\n\nMost British police are also required to carry a 'warrant card', and should under reasonable circumstances be willing to produce it, to confirm their authority. No instant penalties are payable in cash to a police officer and corruption is exceptionally rare; bribing a police officer is a very serious crime for both the officer and person offering the bribe.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Illegal drugs"]},"\n\nAll illegal drugs in the United Kingdom are classified under 'A', 'B' or 'C'. Class A drugs are typically regarded as the most dangerous (not always the case) and attract the most severe penalties (e.g. prison time), especially for supplying. Class C are generally regarded as the least harmful (again not always the case) and thus attract lesser penalties (e.g. fines).  Remember: ",{"type":"'''","value":["all of these drugs are equally illegal"]}," and you can still be arrested for possession, supplying or using regardless of the class; the classes are used to determine policing priorities and penalties.\n\nClass A drugs include ecstasy (MDMA), LSD, heroin and cocaine; penalties will mean arrest and possibly jail even for possession.  Magic mushrooms were previously legal because of technicalities in the law, but are now class A.\n\nCannabis is now a 'Class B' drug. A first offence for possession will usually result in a formal warning, or an on-the-spot fine.  This does not apply to other Class B drugs, such as speed.  Subsequent offences may result in arrest.\n\nExamples of Class C include ketamine, some steroids, some prescription drugs such as Valium (legal if they are prescribed for you), GHB, and some tranquillisers. As of 2013, the British Government is planning to make Khat a Class C drug.\n\nPrescribed drugs may sometimes require a letter from a doctor to be imported.  This applies where the drug is a Controlled Drug (A,B or C) in the UK.\n\nDrug use is a growing concern for authorities, with some of the highest levels in Europe. Cannabis and ecstasy are both very widely available and you could even be offered it if you are in the right location such as certain markets and clubs.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Prostitution"]},"\n\nAlthough technically the act of prostitution is not in itself illegal in the UK, many laws criminalise activities associated with it. \n\nBrothels of any kind are illegal under the 1956 Sexual Offences Act, and it's against the law to loiter or solicit sex on the street. 'Kerb-crawling' (driving close to a pavement in order to ask prostitutes for sex) is also banned, and is actively monitored for by police patrols in many towns and cities across the country. \n\nIt should be noted that although exchanging money for sex is not in itself prohibited, many legal grey-areas do exist in this department, and the attitude towards the trade is generally not as liberal as in many other European countries.\n\nIn larger cities, Police  have in recent years begun crackdowns against organised gangs  that are using trafficked women\nin prostitution rackets.  Police take a very dim view of such activity, and if you are caught in the premises of such gangs, \nyou will at the very least be thoroughly questioned by police.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nIf you have a medical emergency, telephone ",{"type":"'''","value":["999"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["112"]},", or go directly to the nearest ",{"type":"'''","value":["Accident & Emergency"]}," (or ",{"type":"'''","value":["Emergency Department"]},"). Within the UK, emergency medical response is prioritized on clinical basis, and the operator\/dispatcher will ask relevant questions to ensure an appropriate response. Do not be alarmed by such questions.\n\nFor advice on non-emergency medical problems, you can ring the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk\/ 24-hour NHS Direct"]}," service on 0845 4647 (",{"type":"''","value":["NHS 24"]}," in Scotland on 08454 242424)\n\nEmergencies can be dealt with under the NHS (National Health Service) at any hospital with a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Casualty"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["A & E"]}," (Accident & Emergency) department. At A&E be prepared to wait for up to 4 hours to be seen to if the medical complaint is not serious, depending on the time of day\/night. The longest waiting times usually occur on Friday and Saturday nights. Walk-in centres also provide treatment for less urgent conditions on a first come first served basis. They are open to residents and foreign nationals.\n\nWhilst emergency medical treatment is generously provided to all at no charge to the patient, Visitors from the EU are advised to have an EHIC card, and visitors from beyond the EU (such as the US, Canada and Australia) would be advised to have appropriate travel health insurance coverage, to cover the cost of additional expenses beyond basic treatment. Citizens and permanent residents of some countries are entitled to free reciprocal healthcare benefits when visiting the UK. Check the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/Pages\/HomePage.aspx NHS web-site"]}," for more details. Long-term visitors on work visas, or student visas of over 6 months in length are allowed limited access to the NHS system.\n\nFor advice on minor ailments and medicines, you can ask a pharmacist. Notable pharmacy chains include Boots and Lloyds (both having high-street branches nationally), many supermarkets also have pharmacists in-store.\n\nIf you require specific medication, be sure to include a written prescription from a qualified medical professional, as misunderstandings have occasionally arisen. The medicine trade is strictly controlled in the UK and many medicines available to purchase from a pharmacy in other countries eg, antibiotics or opiate based painkillers can only be provided on production of a prescription written by an authorised medical professional. In addition a number of medications (and nominally over the counter remedies) can only be sold by qualified staff. (To practise legally all pharmacists must be registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) which involves a university degree and other exams and training). \n\nIt is also strongly advised that written documentation is obtained from a qualified medical professional if you have a medical condition which requires you to inject anything, regardless of it status. British police (and door security) will not be sympathetic to what they, however wrongly, suspect to be potential means of drug abuse.\n \nThere are around 50,000 ",{"type":"[[","value":[["HIV"]]}," victims living in the UK. Chlamydia is common enough that young people are recommended to be regularly tested. Condoms are available in toilets, pharmacies, and supermarkets. They are also available free from some NHS sexual health clinics (known as GUM clinics), which also provide free STI testing and treatment, even if you are not eligible for other NHS services.\n\nTap water is safe to drink everywhere, unless otherwise stated. Non drinking water sources are typically marked in an obvious manner.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\nThe UK's time zone is GMT+0, but during the 'summer' (March-October) the clocks are one hour ahead (British Summer Time.)\n\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["electrical systems"],["electricity supply"]]}," runs at ",{"type":"'''","value":["230V, 50 Hz AC"]},". Visitors from countries such as the US and Canada, where the voltage supply runs at 110V 60 Hz, may need a voltage converter (which can be picked up in most specialist electronic shops). Many appliances needed whilst travelling (such as laptop chargers, shavers and the like) are designed to run off both voltages, however check on the label before setting off.\n\nBritish plugs and sockets, made to the British Standard 1363, have three flat, rectangular pins which form a triangle. These sockets are the same used in Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and several other former British colonies. It is possible to force a thin Europlug (with no earth pins) into the socket, however this is not recommended for obvious reasons. Most shops will sell plug adapters, but don't buy them from un-reputable sources. Using plug adapters from these sources carries the risk of fire or electrocution.  There is also a 2 pin style shaver socket (BS 4573).\n\nPower connectors for outdoor use (most likely encounter as a caravan hookup), are based on a European wide standard(IEC 60309), with the relevant type for UK mains voltage being 'blue' in colour. \n\nUK uses a PAL based system for TV and video equipment, although this is unlikely to be a concern unless you are bringing specific 'foreign' equipment with you. If you needing a specific video format when shopping, ask the shop or vendor concerned.\n\nNote that during the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Christmas"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["New Year"]}," holiday period much of the country shuts down. During the week leading up to Christmas people will travel to their hometowns to visit their family, meaning that the motorway traffic can be very heavy and trains are much more crowded. Also, many people rush to shopping areas to stock up on food and drink and last-minute gifts. On Christmas Day, Boxing Day (Dec 26th) and New Year's Day most businesses will close (including supermarkets and most restaurants and bars) although major hotels remain open. If you need to purchase food, drink or cigarettes on these days then most petrol (gas) station convenience stores will still be open but almost everything else is closed, and on Christmas Day itself even many of these are closed. Many large shops are open (and extremely busy) on Boxing Day. If you don't have a car then avoid travelling on these days as the only available transport in many areas is taxis, which will charge up to three times the regular price. If you have a car then it is much better as roads are almost empty on Christmas Day and parking is often free - however many petrol stations are closed on Christmas Day (except those at Motorway Service Stations, which must be open by law) so plan your journey carefully if you will need to refuel. In many areas, bus and train services finish much earlier than usual on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, and do not run on Christmas Day or Boxing Day. Buses also tend not to run on New Years Day, outside of major cities. During the week between Christmas and New Year, many transport services operate revised schedules and it is advisable to check with operators.\n\nThe major national holidays are:\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\""],["!Date"],["!Event"],["!Notes"],["|-"],["||Jan-1st||New Year"],["|-"],["||varies (March-April)||Good Friday"],["|-"],["||varies (March-April)||Easter Monday"],["|-"],["||1st Monday in May||May day Bank Holiday"],["|-"],["||Last Monday in May||Spring Bank Holiday"],["|-"],["||Last Monday in August||Summer Bank Holiday||This is a peak time date for vists to various UK resorts, traffic congestion is also high."],["|-"],["||Dec 25||Christmas Day"],["|-"],["||Dec 26||Boxing Day"],["|-"]]},"\n\nIt should also be noted that on the Sunday following Nov 11th (and Nov 11th itself), many business and civic facilities will pause at 11am for \"Remembrance Day\" or \"Remembrance Sunday\" events. Polite respect for these is strongly suggested, even if you personally disagree with the sentiment implied.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nIt's acceptable to address someone by their first name in most social situations.  First names are sometimes avoided among strangers to avoid seeming overly familiar. In very formal or business situations first names are not commonly used until people are better acquainted. The best strategy is to use what they introduced themselves with. Officials, however, (like policemen or doctors) will invariably call you by your title and surname, for example \"Mr Smith\".\n\nThe British can be extremely indirect when requesting things from people they do not know. It is common for Britons to \"ask around\" questions when requesting something: for example, one would be more likely to say something along the lines of \"Where can I find the changing room?\" when in a clothes shop, rather than \"Where's the changing room?\". Although asking questions directly is quite common, it can sometimes be seen as overly abrupt or even rude.\n\nSimilarly, saying 'What?' when not understanding something can be considered rude around authority figures or people you don't know, so 'Pardon?' or 'Sorry?' is more appropriate to use in situations with a stranger or a superior. British people apologise a lot, even when there is absolutely no need to do so. For example, if someone trod on someone else's toe by accident, ",{"type":"''","value":["both"]}," people would normally apologise. This is just a British thing to do, and dwelling on it (e.g. \"What are you sorry about?\") will mark you out as a foreigner. Often a British person will request something or start a conversation with 'sorry'. It isn't because they feel sorry, but it is rather used instead of \"excuse me\" or \"pardon\".\n\nAllow some ",{"type":"'''","value":["personal space"]}," between you and others in queues and elsewhere. You will usually find this in such places as cinemas. Generally, unless people know each other, you will find they will usually choose to fill up every row of seating and keep as much distance of possible until there is a requirement to sit directly next to each other. Exceptions are in very crowded situations where this is impossible, like on the Tube.\n\nGreetings are dependent upon the situation. In anything but a business situation, a verbal greeting (such as 'hello (name)!') will suffice. Younger people will usually say 'Hi,' 'Hiya,' or 'Hey' though the latter is also used to attract attention and should not be used to address a stranger as it would be considered impolite. Another British greeting (frequently used by younger people) is 'You all right?' or 'All right?' (sometimes abbreviated to \"A' right\" in northern England), which is basically a combination of 'Hello' and 'How are you?'. This term can be confusing to foreigners, but it can be easily replied to with either a greeting back (which is far more common) or stating how you feel (usually something short like 'I'm fine, you?'). \n\nA greeting may sometimes be accompanied by a kiss on the cheek or less commonly a hug. Etiquette for a hug is somewhat complicated, so the best advice is to accept a hug (regardless of the gender offering it) if it is offered, otherwise a handshake is appropriate. In a formal situation or an initial greeting between two strangers, a handshake is the done thing, this should be of an appropriate firmness (generally moderate firmness).\n\nFor more details on unwritten rules concerning greetings, addressing others, small talk, British hypocrisy, etc, read ",{"type":"''","value":["Watching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour"]}," by the anthropologist, Kate Fox (ISBN 0340752122).\n\nThe Scottish are Scottish, the Welsh are Welsh, and the English are English. Referring to all of them as \"English\" can offend. Remember too that most Northern Ireland Unionists would not want to be called Irish. By contrast, most of the Nationalists in Northern Ireland will identify as Irish and register accordingly as Irish citizens and carry Irish passports, which all people born in Northern Ireland are entitled to do if they wish. You may also find that even though all the people of the United Kingdom are legally classed as British, people often prefer to be referred to based upon which country in the United Kingdom they were born in, rather than using the collective term British. It is also common to meet someone who might say \"I am half Welsh, half English\" or \"my parents are Scottish and I am English\".\n\nOne should avoid referring to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Falkland Islands"]]}," as being Argentine because it is quite a sensitive issue to some: 250 British soldiers died fighting to defend the islands from Argentine control in 1982. As the war was won by the British, the Falklands remain a British Overseas Territory to this day. To a lesser extent, the same advice applies when talking about ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gibraltar"]]},", as Spain claim it as their own.   \n\nWhile doing the V sign with the ",{"type":"'''","value":["palm facing outward"]}," is taken to indicate either \"peace\" or \"victory\" by many Britons, doing the ",{"type":"'''","value":["reverse"]}," where the palm faces inward is considered to be an offensive gesture, equivalent to raising the middle finger.\n\nSame-sex displays of affection will not likely cause upset or offence apart from some rural areas or in rougher parts of many cities.

Cities such as Brighton host pride festivals each year. Civil partnerships have been legal since 2005. However, someone looking to start a fight may decide to treat somebody's sexuality as a pretext. Try to avoid eye contact with drunks in city centres at night, especially if they are in a large group. It is also important to note, if in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Ireland"]]},", same-sex displays and activities are rarely shown, outside ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belfast"]]},", where many will still hold conservative values. Keeping in mind, while in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belfast"]]}," some areas are safer than others for showing affection. While 'cross-dressing' is not illegal in the UK, it is usually advised to be modest in the choice of outfit, unless you have prior knowledge of local standards.\n\nUrinating in public is now illegal, if you're caught urinating, you'll be given a telling off by the police, made to pay an £80 fine, and, at some areas, be made to clean up your own urine with a mop and disinfectant, which can be embarrassing to offenders. In addition, 'indecent exposure' (defined as exposure of the genitals with the intent to shock people who do not want to see them) is treated as a sexual offence.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Telephone"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Red telephone box, St Paul's Cathedral, London, England, GB, IMG 5182 edit.jpg"],["thumb"],["A red telephone box, which is now a symbol of Britain despite there being comparatively few on the streets today."]]},"\n\nIn case of emergency, call ",{"type":"'''","value":["999"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["112"]}," from any phone. \n\nSuch calls are free and will be answered by an emergency services operator who will ask you which service(s) you need (police, fire, ambulance, coastguard or mountain rescue) and for your location. \n\nYou can call ",{"type":"'''","value":["999"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["112"]}," from any mobile telephone as well, even if you do not have roaming enabled.

If calling from a landline to another landline within the same area code the area code can usually be omitted, except in the Bournemouth and Poole area in the south of England where the area code (01202) is always required.\n\nFor calls to UK mobile telephones from anywhere within the UK all of the digits have to be dialled by all callers.\n\nWhen the building you're in has its own internal phone system, the number for an outside line is \"9\" (not \"0\", as in many other countries, which in the UK usually connects you to the reception desk).\n\nArea codes in the UK do not have a set pattern, London numbers start 020 (with 0208 and 0207 replacing the former 0181 and 0171 area codes). \n\nPayphones are widely available, especially in stations, airports, etc. They are also found on the streets in phone boxes, most notably the red ones, but there are different designs of phone box. Payphones usually take cash (minimum 60p - BT, although some private payphones may charge more); change is not given, but you can choose to continue your money on to the next call. Some newer payphones accept credit and debit cards and may even allow you to send emails and surf the web. Phonecards have been largely phased out, though various pre-paid phonecards can be purchased from newsagents for cheap international calls. Some BT payphones now accept euros.  \n\nA simpler and often cheaper alternative for international calls is to use a direct-dial service. These can offer reduced call rates over the standard providers when called from a landline, and don't require you to purchase a card or sign up for an account. You simply dial an access number (e.g. 0844 or 0871 prefix) and the revenue-share element of the call price pays for the onward international part of the call.\n\nWhether you are calling someone who is inside or outside the UK, it may be important to find out if the phone number being called corresponds to a landline or mobile phone as most operators have different rates for both modes within a particular country.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Mobile "]},"\nMobile phones are heavily used.  The main networks are ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.t-mobile.co.uk\/ T-Mobile"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.vodafone.co.uk\/ Vodafone"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.orange.co.uk\/ Orange"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.three.co.uk\/ 3"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.o2.co.uk\/ O2"]},", and all have use of 3G services as well as GPRS (excluding 3). GPRS and 3G data services are available, usually priced per megabyte. GPRS (Voice, Text, Basic Internet) coverage is very well developed, covering 99% of the population, 3G (MMS, Video, Internet etc.) coverage is also very good in the UK (dependent on network), however it may lack in rural areas. T-Mobile and Orange are both run by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/everythingeverywhere.com\/ Everything Everywhere"]},", and therefore these two networks share each others' signal.\n\nThere is no charge for calls that you receive on your handset except for those roaming; charges are only for calls that you initiate.\n\nPay as you go (prepaid) plans are available.  Credit the phone with a top-up card or cash payment via a top-up terminal; there is no contract and no bills.  Some operators also offer packages which mix texts, phone calls and\/or data at affordable rates.  These packages can come with your initial top-up or deducted from your balance.  \n\nIf you have an unlocked GSM-compatible handset (most dual- and tri-band phones are GSM-compatible) you can purchase a SIM card from several  electrical or phone outlets, in supermarkets, or online. Be aware prices do vary considerably – from £5 (with £10 call credit) from Tesco online (available in Tesco supermarkets) to £30 (with £2.50 credit) from Vodafone (available at all mobile phone shops).  Often bargain handset-and-SIM deals can be found, if you don't have an unlocked handset - at the time of writing you can get a very basic mobile with SIM for £18 from Tesco, though note that this will be a locked phone and won't work with other SIM cards.\n\nThe UK has extensive mobile phone coverage - 99% of the UK mainland is covered. Many towns and cities have 3G coverage as well.\n\nCosts for calls can vary significantly depending on when you call, where from and where to. Calls from hotel rooms can be spectacularly expensive because of the hotel surcharges; check before you use and consider using the lobby payphones instead. Calls from payphones and wired, or landline, phones to mobile phones can be expensive too; if you have the choice call the other party's landline. Beware of premium rate calls, which can be very expensive. Text messaging from mobiles costs around 10 pence per message and picture or MMS messages cost around 45 pence (20 pence on some networks).\n\nCalls between landlines are usually charged at a single national rate. Some providers charge a higher rate to Jersey, Alderney, Guernsey, Sark and the Isle of Man.\n\nIf the originating and destination area codes are the same then the area code can be omitted when calling from a landline. Note that local calls are not generally free unless someone you may be staying with has a particular contract with their landline provider. The following table relates the first few digits dialled to call types, so you can avoid some of the pitfalls above:\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\""],["! Digits dialled !!

All UK public libraries provide access, often branded as \"People's Network\", usually at little or no charge, although time is rationed. Some hotels and hostels also offer internet access either via their cable TV system or Wi-Fi, although the prices are quite steep (www.spectrumineractive.co.uk provide the Scottish YHA with a network of broadband and WiFi-capable Internet terminals).\n\nA number of ISPs charge nothing for Internet access by telephone modem - they get their payment from the phone company; local call costs are time-related. Examples are ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.Gonuts4Free.com\/ GoNuts4Free"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.DialUKT.com\/ DialUKT"]},".\n\nThere are some Wi-Fi hotspots, although intentionally publicly available wireless is not yet widespread outside central London. Most McDonald's restaurants in the UK now offer free Wi-Fi.  Many coffee shops offer paid Wi-Fi.  The most you should pay for Wi-Fi access across the UK is £1 for half an hour.  Many chain cafés will charge more for no extra value. There is also extensive BT Wi-Fi and they charge £4 for one hour and £39 for a month\n\nMost of the UK is covered by UMTS\/HSDPA 3G coverage, giving download speeds up to 7.2Mbit\/s, and GPRS coverage is extensive. 3G data services should roam seamlessly onto the UK networks, or you can purchase a pay-as-you-go SIM card for which credit can be purchased in the same way as for mobile phones. For example T-Mobile stores will give you a free SIM-card on which you can load any amount you want. Access cost £2 per day, £7 per week. 4G LTE is also being slowly rolled out across larger cities in the UK. Note there is no 3G connectivity in the Orkney Isles, only GPRS.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Post"]},"\n\nThe Royal Mail has a long history. Postboxes are still the traditional red colour (although there are green and gold Victorian \"Penfold\" boxes retained in some areas and an historically important blue box in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Windsor and Eton"],["Windsor"]]},").  Mail can also be posted at post offices.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Postal rates"]},"\nThe Royal Mail has introduced a new system where post within the UK is priced on size ",{"type":"'''","value":["and"]}," weight. You can find size charts at all post offices but bear this in mind when sending a larger envelope, parcel or packet.\n\nPostage stamps for within the UK (Channel Islands and Isle of Man included) cost ",{"type":"'''","value":["53p"]},"\/",{"type":"'''","value":["62p"]}," (domestic 1st\/2nd class for envelopes up to C5 size which are less than 5mm thick and less than 100g).\n\nPostage stamps for international mail cost:\n\nInternational Economy (previously known as Surface Mail): ",{"type":"'''","value":["81p"]}," (postcards and letters up to 20g, available to destinations outside Europe only)\n\nInternational Standard (previously known as Airmail): ",{"type":"'''","value":["97p"]}," (postcards and letters up to 20g to destinations in Europe), ",{"type":"'''","value":["£1.28"]}," (postcards and letters up to 20g to destinations outside Europe).\n\nRates correct as of March 2014.\n\nStamps can be bought at supermarkets, newsagents and tourist shops. Domestic first-class mail can usually be expected to arrive the following day; second-class mail may take several days. Signage on all postboxes displays the final collection time at that location (typically about 17:30 on weekdays and noon on Saturdays), as well as details of later weeknight collections that are available in many areas from a central postbox or sorting office. Deliveries are likewise made six mornings per week, Monday to Saturday. There is generally no post on Sundays or Public Holidays.\n\nIf you wish to send something heavy, or want to send a larger letter or packet within the UK, then you will have to get it weighed and\/or measured at the post office.  The staff at post offices are very helpful, but avoid the lunchtime rush at around 12:00-13.30 when there is often a long queue and 30min+  waiting times.\n\nOne interesting side-pursuit is to look at when the postboxes were built since some can be very old. The 'R' stands for Rex\/Regina and the first letter the initial of the monarch reigning when it was cast. For example, a postbox built after 1952 would have the initials 'E II R'. Finding a box with the initials 'VR' (Queen Victoria, pre-1901) is possible, but quite a feat.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["54.41893"],["-0.79102"],["zoom=6"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Britain and Ireland"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecountry"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:United Kingdom"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/United Kingdom\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:United Kingdom"]]}]
