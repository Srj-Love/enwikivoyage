In part to finance the North American campaigns of the war, known as the French and Indian War, Britain imposed unpopular taxes and regulations on its colonists. This precipitated revolution in 1775 and on 4 July 1776, colonists from 13 colonies declared full independence.

The 1803 ",{"type":"'''","value":["Louisiana Purchase"]}," of French lands to the west of the Mississippi effectively doubled the country's area, and provided \"Indian Territory\" in what is now Oklahoma for the many Native American tribes from the east that were forcibly relocated during the Trail of Tears of the 1830s.\n\nDisagreements with British commerce policies arising from the Napoleonic Wars and Royal Navy impressment led to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["War of 1812"]},".

The national anthem, ",{"type":"'''","value":["\"The Star-Spangled Banner\""]},", was conceived during the war. Western Native American tribes that had sided with the British suffered greatly as their territory was given to white settlers.\n\nAfter the war, industry and infrastructure were expanded greatly, particularly in the Northeast.

Native Americans were relegated to reservations and continued to be purged by treaty, military force, and disease from settlers on the Oregon Trail and other westward routes.\n\nFederal governance was light and the individual states were highly autonomous. By the 1850s, there was irreconcilable disparity between the industrialized and more urban Northern states, which had all outlawed slavery within three decades of the revolution, and the plantation-dependent rural South.

The ensuing ",{"type":"'''","value":["American Civil War"]}," remains the bloodiest conflict on American soil and killed hundreds of thousands. In 1865, Union forces prevailed, firmly cementing the federal government's authority over the states. Slavery was abolished nationwide and the Confederate states were re-admitted into the Union during a period of Reconstruction. The former slaves and their descendants were to remain an economic and social underclass, particularly in the South.\n\nRussia sold its tenuously held Alaskan territory in 1867, and the previously independent Hawaii was annexed in 1898. The United States' decisive victory over Spain in the 1898 ",{"type":"'''","value":["Spanish–American War"]}," gained it colonial territories: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuba"]]}," (granted independence a few years later), the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philippines"]]}," (granted independence shortly after World War II), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Rico"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guam"]]}," (which remain American dependencies).\n\nIn the late 19th and into the 20th century, Southern and Eastern Europeans, Russian Jews, and Irish refugees bolstered the continuing industrialization of the eastern cities by providing cheap labor. Many Southern African-Americans fled rural poverty for industrial jobs in the North. Other immigrants, including many Scandinavians and Germans, moved to newly opened territories in the West and Midwest, where land was given to anyone who would develop it.\n\nThe United States' entrance into ",{"type":"'''","value":["World War I"]}," in 1917 marked the start of an era it would ultimately dominate politically. However, soon after the victory the U.S. eschewed international involvement and refused to join the nascent League of Nations, effectively crippling the organization. Real wealth grew rapidly and the Roaring 20s saw stock speculation that created an immense \"bubble\" which burst in 1929, leading to the global economic havoc of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Great Depression"]},". The resulting privation fostered a culture of sacrifice and hard work that would serve the country well in the coming conflict.  It also ushered in Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his \"New Deal\", a series of government programs that constructed thousands of buildings and bridges across the country while creating the basis of the American welfare state.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:USS Arizona Memorial.JPG"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["The USS Arizona Memorial at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pearl Harbor"]]}]]},"\nIn 1941 Japan attacked ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pearl Harbor"]},", a Hawaiian naval base, plunging the United States into ",{"type":"'''","value":["World War II"]}," alongside British, Soviet, and Chinese allies. The U.S. developed atomic bombs and dropped them twice on Japan in 1945, abruptly ending the war. By the end of the war, the United States had firmly established itself as the world's dominant economic power, responsible for nearly half of global industrial production.  The subsequent nuclear-armed ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cold War"]}," saw the United States and the Soviet Union jostle for power while courting their own mutually assured destruction.\n\nFor the century after the Civil War, blacks, though ostensibly equal citizens under the post-Civil War amendments to the U.S. Constitution, suffered through strong social and economic, political, and social discrimination and state-sanctioned segregation, especially in the South. A movement fighting for full civil rights for black Americans gained strength following World War II, when returning black veterans who fought against racism abroad came home to find they were still being denied service at lunch counters, hotels, and many other establishments and facing discrimination in employment and housing. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["civil rights movement"]}," vehemently, but largely peacefully, vied for equal rights. With ",{"type":"'''","value":["Martin Luther King, Jr."]},", a charismatic preacher, as its most visible leader, the movement came to a head in 1963 when 200,000–300,000 people flooded the capital to listen to him. A revived women's movement in the 1960s also led to wide-ranging changes in American society.\n\nPostwar America was characterized by affluence and industrialization. People left agriculture  and moved to the cities to become part of an increasingly technology-based economy. American car culture emerged in the 1950s and was supported by the construction of a comprehensive Interstate Highway System. The American consumer culture, as well as Hollywood movies and many forms of popular music, arguably established the United States as the cultural center of the world. The U.S. has also grown into one of the world's major centers of higher education, being home to some of the world's most prestigious universities, and attracting more international students than any other country in the world.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Government and politics"]},"\n\nThe United States is a federal republic. Its major constituents are the 50 states and the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.); it also has various island territories in the Caribbean and Pacific that are strongly – but often not fully – integrated into the union. Many of these territories are within the U.S. customs and immigration area and so for practical purposes can be considered part of the U.S. (See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America#Travel to U.S. possessions"],["Travel to U.S. possessions"]]},").\n\nThe federal government derives its power from the Constitution, which is the oldest written constitution in continuous use. Within the overarching federal laws, each state maintains its own constitution, government and laws, and so retains considerable autonomy within the federation. State laws can vary in their details but are, for the most part, fairly uniform from state to state.\n\nThe President is elected every four years and is the head of the federal government as well as head of state. His administration forms the executive branch. The bicameral Congress (comprising the lower House of Representatives and the upper Senate) constitutes the legislative branch. The Supreme Court tops the judicial branch. State governments are organized similarly, with governors, legislatures, and judiciaries.\n\nTwo major political parties have dominated at both state and federal levels since the end of the Civil War: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. While smaller political parties exist, the winner-take-all electoral system means that they rarely succeed at any level.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Culture"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Bourbon Street New Orleans Louisiana USA.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["The South's famous Bourbon Street, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Louisiana"]]}]]},"\n\nThe United States is made up of many diverse ethnic groups and the culture varies greatly across the vast area of the country and even within cities – a city like New York will have dozens, if not hundreds, of different ethnicities represented within a neighborhood. Despite this difference, there exists a strong sense of national identity and certain predominant cultural traits. Generally, Americans tend to believe strongly in personal responsibility and that an individual determines his or her own success or failure, but there are many exceptions and that a nation as diverse as the United States has literally thousands of distinct cultural traditions. One will find Mississippi in the South to be very different culturally from Massachusetts in the North.\n\nReligion is very important in the United States. Only 20% of people in the United States identify with no religion, which is very low in comparison to other Western nations. Roughly one-quarter of Americans are Roman Catholic, and one-half of them are Protestant, with Protestantism being further broken down into mainline, Evangelical and Pentecostal sects. There are much smaller numbers of Jews, Mormons, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and a host of other religions. Because of many Americans' strong religious belief, many businesses and institutions are closed on Sundays, and a number of areas in the South and Midwest forbid certain actions from taking place on Sunday, while some Jewish businesses close on Friday nights and Saturdays for the sabbath.\n\nOverall, while the United States is less religious than many other nations, it is more religious than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Europe"]]},"; however, this trend varies greatly by region, with the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pacific Northwest"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New England"]]}," being largely secular and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South (United States of America)"],["American South"]]}," being extraordinarily Christian, particularly Evangelical. Differences in religiosity largely correlate with politics, too, so the Northeast and West Coast are generally liberal and Democratic; most of the South and heavily Mormon states like Utah, Idaho and Wyoming are very conservative and Republican; and much of the rest of the country (e.g., several Midwestern, Southwestern\/Rocky Mountain, and Southern coastal states) is nearly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Holidays"]},"\n\nThere are no nationwide, mandatory public holidays. Federal holidays are the most centrally coordinated holidays, but they are only officially recognized by the federal government; federal offices, banks, and post offices close on these days. Nearly all states and localities also observe these holidays, as well as a handful of their own. If a federal holiday falls on a weekend, the observance will normally be shifted to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["nearest weekday"]},".\n\nThe time between Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday in November) and January 1 has such a high concentration of major holidays that it is often simply called \"the holiday season.\"  School and work vacations are commonly taken during this period, with people visiting family and friends. Airports, bus stations, and train stations will be very crowded near the major holidays. If you must travel, allow extra time to check in and clear security.  This is also a major gift giving season; most shopping malls and department stores will be crowded, especially on the day after Thanksgiving, the week before Christmas, and the day after Christmas.\n\nIn the list below, federal holidays are listed in ",{"type":"'''''","value":["bold italics"]},".\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''''","value":["New Year's Day"]}," (1 January) — most non-retail businesses closed; parades; brunches and football parties."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''''","value":["Martin Luther King Day"]}," (third Monday in January) — many government offices and banks closed; people volunteer in their communities; speeches, especially on African-American history and culture."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Chinese New Year"]}," (January\/February — varies based on the Chinese lunar calendar) — Chinese cultural celebration."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Super Bowl Sunday"]}," (usu. first Sunday in February) — The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the NFL American football league and the most-watched sporting event of the year; supermarkets, bars, and electronics stores busy; big football-watching parties."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Lincoln's Birthday"]}," (second Monday in February) - Holiday in several states; many stores have sales."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["(St.) Valentine's Day"]}," (14 February) — private celebration of romance and love.

Instead it uses \"customary units\" (feet, miles, gallons, pounds, etc.), which are largely derived from the English units of the 18th century, and are sometimes different from the imperial units that occasionally linger in Britain. Road distances are given in miles and speed limits in miles per hour. Gasoline and other liquids are usually sold per gallon, quart, or ounce (a U.S. gallon is 3.78 liters, so a U.S. quart [a ",{"type":"''","value":["quart"]},"er gallon] is slightly less than a liter). Beverages such as soda are sometimes sold by the liter and other times sold by the fluid ounce, with just under 34 ounces to a liter. Temperatures are reported in Fahrenheit only; 32 degrees (with units unspecified) is freezing, not warm! Most cars' speedometers show both miles and kilometers per hour (good for trips to Canada and Mexico), and almost all packaged foods and other products are labeled in both systems. Outside of scientific work, medicine and the military, there is little day-to-day exposure to the metric system, so Americans will assume you understand the U.S. customary measures.\n\nThere is no government regulation of clothes or shoe sizes. There are ill-enforced informal standards, and the only thing you can count on is that sizes tend to be consistent within the same brand. Therefore, trial and error is required for ",{"type":"''","value":["each brand"]}," to determine what fits, because you cannot count on any two brands' sizes being equivalent.

As such, the federal government provides the best information about legal requirements for entry, while information about places to visit and see will be provided by the state and local tourism bureaus. Contact information is available in the individual state entries.  Highway rest stops at state borders, as well as major airports in a state, usually serve as Visitor's Centers and often offer travel and tourism information and material, almost all of which is also available online.

A short trip to Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean will not allow a fresh 90 days upon return to the U.S. An extended absence to the neighboring countries may reset the limit, particularly if your first trip to the U.S. was short. Take care if transiting through the U.S. on a trip around North America that exceeds 90 days.\n\nHaving a criminal record, having been previously refused entry, or having previously been denied a US visa will make one ineligible to enter on the Visa Waiver Program.

When the U.S. rejects a visa application, it is usually because the applicant does not have enough binding ties to his own country to convince the consular officer that the person will not try to overstay.  Applicants need to demonstrate that they are indeed genuinely entitled to the visa they are applying for.  Face-to-face interviews (where the official needs to be convinced that you are not a \"potential immigrant\") at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate are required for almost all nationalities, and waits for interview slots and visa processing can add up to several months.\n\nKeep in mind that the embassy is closed on both U.S. holidays and holidays of your home country so you need to know both holidays when setting dates to apply for a visa.

On the other hand, you can enter the country on the last day of validity of your visa and still be allowed to stay, for example, up to 180 days as a tourist.\n\nApplying for an incorrect or inappropriate visa can cause serious problems, including possibly making you ineligible to ever receive any U.S. visa (especially in cases of fraud).

The national rail system, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.amtrak.com\/ Amtrak"]}," (1-800-USA-RAIL), provides service to many cities, offering exceptional sightseeing opportunities, but not particularly efficient inter-city travel, and is often just as expensive as a flight. In more urban locations, Amtrak can be very efficient and comfortable, but in rural areas delays are common. Plan ahead to ensure train travel between your destinations is available and\/or convenient. They have promotional discounts of 15% for students and seniors, and a 30-day U.S. Rail Pass for international travelers only. If you plan to buy a regular ticket within a week of traveling, it pays to check the website for sometimes significant \"weekly specials\".\n\nAmtrak offers many amenities and services that are lacking from other modes of transport.  Amtrak's routes traverse some of America's most beautiful areas.  Travelers with limited time may not find travel by train to be convenient, simply because the country is ",{"type":"''","value":["big"]},", and that \"bigness\" is particularly evident in many of the scenic areas.  For those with ample time, though, train travel offers an unparalleled view of the U.S., without the trouble and long-term discomfort of a rental (hire) car or the hassle of flying.\n\nTrains running on the Washington D.C. to Boston ",{"type":"'''","value":["Northeast Corridor"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Acela Express"]}," and the ",{"type":"''","value":["Regional"]},") and the Philadelphia to Harrisburg ",{"type":"'''","value":["Keystone Corridor"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Keystone Service"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Pennsylvanian"]},") generally run on time or very close to it. These two rail lines are electrified and owned by Amtrak or other commuter railways and are passenger only. Outside these two areas, Amtrak operates on freight lines and as a result must share track with a host railroad; this means you have about as good a chance of a delay as not.  Delays are usually brief (trains make up time en route) but ",{"type":"'''","value":["have a contingency plan for being at least three hours late when traveling Amtrak"]},".  Six-hour or longer delays, especially on long-distance routes, are not uncommon.\n\nIf you miss an Amtrak connection because your first train is late, Amtrak will book you onto the next available train (or in rare cases a bus) to your final destination. If your destination is on the Northeast Corridor, this isn't a big deal (departures are every hour) but in other parts of the country the next train may not be until tomorrow. If your reservations involved sleeper accommodations (Amtrak's First Class on their long-distance overnight trains) on either your late-arriving train or your missed connection, you will get a hotel voucher for the unplanned overnight stay.  For coach class passengers in the same situation, you will not get a hotel voucher; your unplanned lodging arrangements and cost will be your responsibility.  However, after your travel is completed, Amtrak's Customer Service will commonly offer travel vouchers of $100 or more off future Amtrak travel to inconvenienced passengers.  This is true for all classes of service.\n\nIf you plan to board an Amtrak train at a location other than the train's initial place of departure, it's usually a good idea to call ahead before you leave for the station to see if the train is running on time.\n\nA major Amtrak line in regular daily use by Americans themselves is the ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.amtrak.com\/acela-express-train Acela Express"]}]}," line, running between Boston and Washington, D.C. It stops in New York City, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Haven"]]},", Philadelphia and many other cities on the way. This line is electrified, with top speeds of 150 miles per hour (though the average speed is a good deal slower).  The Acela Express has first class service, but can be quite expensive. Given the difficulty and expense of getting from the center of some of the major Northeastern cities to their respective airports, trains can sometimes be more convenient than air travel. There are also frequent but slower regional trains covering the same stations along the Northeast Corridor for lower fares.\n\nDuring usual American vacation times, some long-distance trains (outside the Northeast) can sell out weeks or even months in advance, so it pays to book early if you plan on using the long-distance trains. Booking early also results in generally lower fares for all trains since they tend to increase as trains become fuller.  On the other hand, same-day reservations are usually easy, and depending on the rules of the fare you purchased, you can change travel plans on the day itself without fees.\n\nOne major scenic long-distance train route, the ",{"type":"''","value":["California Zephyr"]},", runs from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Emeryville"]]}," in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bay Area (California)"],["Bay Area"]]}," of California to Chicago, via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reno"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salt Lake City"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]},". The full trip takes around 60 hours, but has incredible views of the Western deserts, the Rocky Mountains, and the Great Plains, things that you just cannot see if you fly. Many of the sights on this route are simply inaccessible to cars. The trains run only once per day, and they usually sell out well in advance.\n\nAmtrak's single most popular long-distance train is the Chicago-Seattle\/Portland \"Empire Builder\" train via Milwaukee, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Twin Cities"],["St. Paul\/Minneapolis"]]},", Fargo, Minot, Glacier National Park, Whitefish, and Spokane.

Amtrak trains in the West feature a lounge car with floor to ceiling windows, which are perfect for sightseeing.\n\nSeparate from Amtrak, many major cities offer very reliable ",{"type":"'''","value":["commuter trains"]}," that carry passengers to and from the suburbs or other relatively close-by areas.  Since most Americans use a car for suburban travel, some commuter train stations have park and ride facilities where you can park your car for the day to use the commuter train to get to a city's downtown core where it may be more difficult to use a car due to traffic and parking concerns.

This applies even to very large cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami, where public transport is very limited and having a car is the most practical way of getting around. (The exceptions are New York City, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., where having your own car is not only unnecessary, but discouraged.) In most medium-sized American cities, everything is very spread out and public transportation thin. Taxis are often available, but if you're not at the airport, you may have to phone for one and wait a half-hour or so to be picked up, making similar arrangements to return. While most Americans are happy to give driving directions, don't be surprised if many aren't familiar with the local public transport options available.\n\nGas stations usually sell regional and national maps.  Online maps with directions are available on several websites including MapQuest and Google Maps. Drivers can obtain directions by calling 1-800-Free411, which will provide them via text message.  GPS navigation systems can be purchased for around $100, and car rental agencies often rent GPS units for a small additional fee.  Many smartphones are now bundled with GPS navigation software that offers turn-by-turn directions. Even states that ban the use of hand-held phones by drivers often allow the use of GPS features, as long as the driver enters no data when in motion (check local laws in the places you will be traveling).\n\nUnlike most of the world, the United States continues to use the imperial measurement system, meaning that road signs are in miles and miles per hour, and fuel is sold in gallons. If driving a car from Canada or Mexico, make sure you know the relevant conversion (1 mile is about 1.6 km). Also, if you're planning to cross into the U.S. by car, read the owner's manual to see how to convert the speedometer from metric to U.S. units—almost all modern cars have speedometers that can display either set of units on demand (changing the speedometer will also change the odometer).\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Great American Road Trip"]},"\nA romantic appeal is attached to the idea of ",{"type":"'''","value":["long-distance car travel"]},"; many Americans will tell you that you can't see the \"real\" America except by car.

In addition, many of the country's major ",{"type":"'''","value":["natural attractions"]},", such as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Canyon"]]},", are almost impossible to get to without an automobile. If you have the time, a classic American road trip with a rented car (see below) is very easy to achieve.  Just keep in mind that because of the distances, this kind of travel can mean many long days behind the wheel, so pay attention to the comfort of the car you use. A \"coast-to-coast\" trip with multiple drivers and minimal stops will take at least five days (four and a half if you have strong bladders).\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Interstate system"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:US Roadsigns.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["There's always a road going your way."]]},"\n\nThe United States is covered with a convenient system of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Interstate highways"]},".  Interstates are always expressways (or \"freeways\")—that is, controlled access divided highways with no grade crossings, the equivalent of what Europeans call a \"motorway\". These roads connect all of the major population centers, and they make it easy to cover long distances—or get to the other side of a large city  quickly.\n\nPrimary Interstates have one- or two-digit numbers, with odd ones running north-south (e.g. I-5) and even ones running east-west (e.g. I-80).  Three-digit interstate numbers designate shorter, secondary routes.  An odd first digit signifies a \"spur\" into or away from a city; an even first digit signifies a \"loop\" around a large city. The second two digits remain the same as the primary Interstate that travels nearby (e.g., I-495 is a loop that connects to I-95).\n\nThe vast majority of Interstates do not charge tolls, but several eastern states operate cross-state Interstate toll roads called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Turnpikes"]}," (or the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Thruway"]}," in New York).  Other states have also started to implement tolls to defray their maintenance costs.  While the majority of these tolls can still be paid in cash (no credit cards or traveler's checks), states are increasingly turning to electronic tolling.  Ask your rental car agency or auto club about the tolling options available to you.\n\nSpeed limits on the interstate highways can vary from state to state, and also according to geography (for example, slower on mountain passes and within cities than on long straight rural sections). Posted speed limits can range from as low as 45 miles per hour (70 km\/h) in densely urban areas to as much as 85 miles per hour (135 km\/h) in rural stretches of Texas, but mostly they'll be between 65 and 75 mph (105–120 km\/h). The speed limits (in miles per hour) are always clearly posted on interstates.\n\nAmerican drivers often drive 5 to 10 miles per hour (8–16 km\/h) over the posted speed limit; driving slower than the speed limit can actually be dangerous. A good rule of thumb is to avoid driving much faster than 5 mph (8 km\/h) over the speed limit, and be sure that some other cars are always passing you; avoid being the fastest ",{"type":"''","value":["or"]}," the slowest vehicle.  It is customary for the slowest traffic to keep to the right while faster traffic passes on the left.  If you are pulled over by police for speeding, the excuse \"Everyone else is speeding too\" will not help. Highway Patrol officers are usually most concerned with the fastest drivers, so ensuring you are slower than the fastest speeders is one way to avoid their attention. If you are pulled over, be respectful, address the officer as \"Officer,\" and express heartfelt regret at your excessive speed.  You will nearly always get a ticket, but it never hurts to express regret as maybe you will get lucky and only receive a warning.\n\nMany U.S. Interstate Highways, particularly around and through very large cities, will segregate the far left-hand lane or lanes and reserve them for high-occupancy use. These lanes are clearly signed, marked which white diamonds down the center of the lane, typically have double-white lines on the right, and are limited to vehicles with multiple occupants (usually two, sometimes three). High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes, called ",{"type":"''","value":["HOV lanes"]},", are designed to ease congestion on Interstate freeways around large population centers during the very start and very end of the business day, also known colloquially as ",{"type":"''","value":["Rush Hour."]}," Enforcement of these High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes typically coincides with rush-hour, from 7AM to 9AM, and again from 4PM to 6PM on weekdays. Driving in an HOV lane as the sole occupant of a vehicle during these times can result in a traffic citation and fine. Note that motorcycles are allowed to use HOV lanes in all states, even with only one rider.\n\nCommercial rest areas were prohibited on the U.S. Interstate Highway system by the federal government.  As a result, the vast majority of stopping points are state-operated rest areas with public toilets, parking, tourist information, vending machines, and a small picnic area. While there are no restaurants, gas stations, or other stores, some rest areas are equipped with vending machines. (A notable exception are tolled, limited-access highways such as Florida's Turnpike, where exiting would force you to pay a toll; service plazas with both food and gas are found on these highways every 20–40 miles [30–60 km] or so.) Commercial  traveler services tend to congregate on the local roads just off popular interstate exits, even if the exit is miles from the nearest population center.  Sometimes you'll find a ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Truck stops"],["truck stop"]]}]},", an establishment that caters to long-haul truckers but is open to all travelers; Truck stops provide several services all in one building, with a \"greasy-spoon\"-style restaurant, gas station, general store, and even hot showers.  Signs on the highway will indicate the services available at upcoming exits, including gas, food, lodging, and camping, so you can choose a stopping point as you're driving.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Off the Interstates"]},"\n\nA secondary system of federal highways is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["U.S. Highway system"]},".  U.S. Highways may be freeways on some sections, but they are often surface roads, sometimes with just one lane in each direction. U.S. Highways, which generally predate the Interstate system, tend to be older routes that lead through town centers. In many cases, Interstates were constructed roughly parallel to U.S. Highways to expedite traffic that wishes to bypass the cities and towns. If you don't mind stopping at traffic lights and dealing with pedestrians, U.S. Highways can lead you to some interesting off-the-beaten-path sights.\n\nEach state is responsible for maintenance of the Interstates and U.S. Highways (despite the names), but each one also maintains its own system of ",{"type":"'''","value":["State Highways"]}," (or ",{"type":"'''","value":["State Routes"]},") that form the bulk of the inter-community road network.

At ",{"type":"'''","value":["all"]}," intersections, vehicles must stop ",{"type":"''","value":["behind"]}," the thick, white line painted across the road and cannot block crosswalks. There are three ways of indicating how a left turn can be made. Some intersections will have a traffic light with red, yellow, & green left arrows; in this case, treat the signal as you would any other. Many intersections have a 5-light traffic signal, with red, yellow, & green circles and yellow & green left arrows. When a green left arrow is displayed, even if the red circle is simultaneously lit, traffic has the right of way to turn left without the need to yield to oncoming traffic. When just the green circle is lit on a 5-light traffic signal, traffic turning left must yield to oncoming traffic. A few states use a pulsating yellow, left arrow to indicate that left-turning traffic must yield to oncoming traffic. When an intersection just has the simple red, yellow, & green traffic signal, traffic turning left must yield to oncoming traffic when the light is green.  In some urban areas, signals are found on onramps to freeways have a special traffic signal with only red & green lights, which is used during periods of high traffic. At such signals, the light will turn green for a few seconds to allow one vehicle at a time (unless signs instruct otherwise) down the ramp to merge with freeway traffic.  At some intersections, traffic lights aren't needed at certain times of the day when there is little traffic (especially at night) and the traffic light becomes either a pulsating red light—which is treated like a stop sign—or a pulsating yellow light which simply indicates caution (there is no need to slow or stop).  In some areas, all-way stop signs are marked with these flashing red lights, one in each direction.\n\nIn many U.S. cities curbs are painted to reflect the ability to park at a particular location. The colors used and the meaning of the colors used varies from city to city. In general, red (and sometimes yellow) means \"no parking\" and blue designates handicapped parking only (with appropriate license plate or placard). In California, yellow curbs designate loading only (goods\/cargo), white designates passenger pickup or dropoff, and green indicates there is a time limit for parking (look at signs for time limit). Elsewhere, the meaning of curb colors varies. Always follow parking signs and, if you are uncertain whether parking is allowed at a particular spot, it's best to park elsewhere than receive a parking ticket or even have your vehicle towed and impounded (which will result in a large fee to retrieve). A parked vehicle should never block a crosswalk, fire hydrant, or the entrance to a driveway\/alley.\n\nMost American drivers tend to drive calmly and safely in the sprawling residential suburban neighborhoods where the majority of Americans live.  However, freeways around the central areas of big cities often become crowded with a significant proportion of \"hurried\" drivers, who will exceed speed limits, make unsafe lane changes, or follow other cars at unsafe close distances (known as \"tailgating\"). Enforcement of posted speed limits is somewhat unpredictable and varies widely from state to state. Not exceeding the pace of other drivers will usually avoid a troublesome citation. Beware of small towns along otherwise high-speed rural roads (and medium-speed suburban roads); the reduced speed limits found while going through such towns are strictly enforced.\n\nDriving law is primarily a matter of state law and is enforced by state and local police.  Fortunately, widespread adoption of provisions of the Uniform Vehicle Code, and federal regulation of traffic signs under the Highway Safety Act, means that most driving laws do not vary much from one state to the next.  All states publish an official driver's handbook which summarizes state driving laws in plain English.  These handbooks are usually available both on the Web and at many government offices.\n\nAAA publishes a AAA\/CAA Digest of Motor Laws, which is now ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/drivinglaws.aaa.com\/ available online"]}," for free.  The Digest contains comprehensive summaries in plain English of all major driving laws that typically vary between states.  The Digest's coverage includes all U.S states and all Canadian provinces.\n\nInternational visitors age 18 and older can usually drive on their foreign driver's license for up to a year, depending on state law. Licenses that are not in English must be accompanied by an International Driving Permit (IDP) or a certified translation. Persons who will be in the United States for more than a year must obtain a driver's license from the state they are residing in. Written and practical driving tests are required, but they are usually waived for holders of valid Canadian, Mexican, and some European licenses.\n\nTraffic signs often depend on the ability to read English words.  Drivers who can read English will find most signs self-explanatory.  (Progress toward adopting signs with internationally understood symbols is extremely slow; don't count on seeing any.) Distances and speeds will almost always be given in miles and miles per hour (MPH), without these units specified. Some areas near the Canadian and Mexican borders may feature road signs with distances in both miles and kilometers.\n\nTraffic cameras are becoming common in some metropolitan areas and will issue automated traffic citations. Most traffic cameras are positioned at intersections and the most commonly issued citations are not coming to a complete stop when turning right on a red light, not stopping behind the stop line (thick, white line across the road before the crosswalk), and driving through a red light. As of ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.iihs.org\/laws\/cameramap.aspx July 2013"]},", 519 communities across 25 states & D.C. use cameras at intersections for red light infractions and 129 jurisdictions across 13 states & D.C. use cameras to catch speeding.\n\nPolice patrol cars vary in make, model, color, and livery from state to state and even town to town, but all are equipped with red and blue flashing lights and a siren.  If you see the lights or hear the siren, pull to the right-hand shoulder of the road to let them by.  If the patrol car is directly behind you, it's your car the officer is targeting; in that case, pull over as soon as it is practical for you to do so safely, even if this means driving some extra distance. It is extremely important that you pull off the road as soon as you are able. The officer will request to see your drivers license, the registration for the vehicle, and your proof of insurance coverage, and\/or rental car documentation. Most traffic stops are recorded by a video camera in the trooper's patrol car, as well as a lapel mike on their person.

Most rental agencies have downtown offices in major cities as well as offices at major airports. Not all companies allow picking up a car in one city and dropping it off in another (the ones that do almost always charge extra for the privilege); check with the rental agency when making your reservations.\n\nRenting a car at an airport location can sometimes cost 3 times as much as renting the same car (from the same company) at a downtown location, but in other areas, the airport location will be cheaper. On-line travel websites such as Orbitz or Expedia can be useful to compare the best prices and make reservations.\n\nRental agencies accept a valid driver's license from your country, which must be presented with an International Drivers Permit if your license needs to be translated.  You may wish to join some kind of ",{"type":"'''","value":["auto club"]}," before starting a large American road trip, and having a cell phone is a very good idea.

Alternatively, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.betterworldclub.com\/ Better World Club"]}," (+1-866-238-1137) offers similar rates and benefits as AAA with often timelier service and is a more eco-friendly choice (1% of revenue is donated to environmental cleanup programs). Some non-U.S. automobile clubs have affiliate relationships with AAA that allow their members to use AAA services. These include the Canadian Automobile Association (CAA), The Automobile Association in the UK, and ADAC in Germany.\n\nMost Americans renting cars are covered for loss or damage to the rental car either by their credit card or their own private vehicle insurance policy. Without appropriate loss\/damage waiver cover, you could be liable for the entire cost of the car should it be written off in an accident. Purchasing loss\/damage waiver cover and supplemental liability insurance may add up to $30\/day to the price of a rental, in some cases doubling the price of the rental. If you visit the car rental website and identify your country of origin, you may be given a quote which includes the loss\/damage waiver and liability insurance for considerably less.  Many ",{"type":"[[","value":[["travel insurance"]]}," policies include cover for some rental car damage – check your policy against the rental terms and conditions.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Fuel"]},"\nGasoline (\"gas\") is sold by the gallon, at stations that are primarily self-service (you must pump your own gas) with the exception of those in New Jersey and Oregon (where self-service is illegal). The American gallon is smaller than the UK gallon, and equals 3.785 liters.  The U.S. octane scale is different from that used in Europe; a regular gallon of U.S. gasoline is rated at 87 octane, the equivalent of about 92 in Europe.  In most states, gas stations offer a choice of three levels of octane: 87 (regular), 89 (midgrade or plus), and 91 (premium).  Unless you are renting a luxury vehicle, your vehicle will likely require only 87 regular.  If you are driving in the Rocky Mountains area, you may encounter stations that offer gas at lower octane ratings, most commonly 85 octane.  This is suitable for use by 87-octane vehicles at high elevations, but if you're heading for lower elevations, be sure to fill up with 87 octane.\n\nDiesel is not as common, but still widely used and available at most stations, especially those catering to truckers.  Untaxed \"offroad diesel\", sold in rural areas for agricultural use, is dyed red and should not be used in cars, as there are heavy fines if you're caught.\n\nDespite increasing petroleum prices worldwide and some increases in gas taxes, the American consumer-voter's attachment to his automobile, combined with abundant domestic oil reserves and relatively low taxes on gasoline, has kept retail fuel prices much lower than in many parts of the world. Prices fluctuate by region and season. As of May 2014, current prices are averaging near $3.65\/gallon (equivalent to $0.97\/liter) for regular and $3.95\/gallon for diesel ($1.05\/liter).\n\nGas prices vary dramatically from state to state based on a number of variables, primarily state sales tax rates (which are invariably included in the advertised price). The highest prices are usually found in Hawaii, Alaska, the West Coast, Illinois, and New York. The lowest are generally found in the south central U.S. A good rule of thumb to find cheaper gas is to venture away from the highway and city centers. There are numerous mobile apps written that will display the cheapest fuel prices within a set range.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["seealso"],["Intercity bus travel in the United States"]]},"\nIntercity bus travel in the United States is widespread, and while not available everywhere, there are at least three daily routes in every state. Service between nearby major cities is extremely frequent (e.g. as of July 2012 there are 82 daily buses, by seven operators, on an off-peak weekday each way between Boston-New York, an average of nearly one every 10 minutes during daytime hours). Many patrons use bus travel when other modes aren't readily available, as buses often connect many smaller towns with regional cities.  The disadvantaged and elderly may use these bus lines, as automobile travel proves arduous or unaffordable for some.

Hence if you do not have one, you can purchase a prepaid card or gift card with Visa, MasterCard or AmEx logo for yourself in a good number of stores but you may need to provide identification before the card is activated.\n\nTransaction authorization is made by signing a paper sales slip or a computer pad, although many retailers will waive the signature requirement for small purchases. The U.S. is in the process of implementing the EMV \"chip-and-PIN\" credit card authorization system used overseas. The deadline for financial institutions to convert to using only EMV chip cards is October 2015. Since chip-and-PIN card readers were virtually non-existent in early 2014 and most financial institutions don't plan to begin replacing existing cards until late 2014\/early 2015, don't expect to find many compatible card readers until the 2015 deadline draws near. After October 2015, retailers may still require a signature on a paper slip or computer pad as opposed to using a PIN (as it's the \"chip\" technology that's being mandated).\n\nGas station pumps, selected public transportation vending machines, and some other types of automated vending machines often have credit\/debit card readers. Many gas station pumps and some automated vending machines that accept credit cards ask for the ZIP code (i.e., postal code) of the U.S. billing address for the card, which effectively prevents them from accepting foreign cards (they are unable to detect a foreign card and switch to PIN authentication).  At gas stations, you can use a foreign issued card by paying the station attendant inside.  If you live in Canada and are using a card with the MasterCard logo, you can use it at all U.S. pumps that require a ZIP code prompt by entering the digits of your postal code (ignoring letters and spaces) and adding two zeroes to the end. When using a debit card, some stations will place a hold on your account for a specified amount (a notice will be present on the pump, typically $75) and then update the charge once you've filled up (but there is often a 1-2 delay between removing the \"hold\" and updating the amount charged).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Gift cards"]},"\n\nEach major commercial establishment (e.g. store, restaurant, online service) with a statewide, regional, nationwide or online presence makes its own gift card available to consumers for use at any of its establishments nationwide or its online store.  In spite of the word \"gift\" in gift card, you can actually purchase and use these cards for yourself.  A gift card for a certain establishment can be purchased at any of the establishment's branches.  Supermarkets and pharmacies also have a variety of gift cards from different stores, restaurants and other services.  Once these are purchased by you or given to you by friends, you can use a particular store or restaurant's gift card at any of its branches nationwide or online store for any amount.  In case funds in the gift card are insufficient, you can use other payment methods to pay for the balance (like cash, credit card, a 2nd gift card particular to the establishment).  The gift card also has instructions on how to check your remaining balance online. Gift cards will not likely work in branches outside the U.S.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Sales tax"]},"\nThere is no nationwide sales tax (such as VAT or GST), although nationwide taxes are levied on certain goods, notably motor fuels (gasoline and diesel). As a result, state or local taxes cannot be refunded by customs agents upon your leaving the U.S.\n\nMost states have a retail ",{"type":"'''","value":["sales tax"]}," of roughly 3–10% (4–6% is typical).

Instead it will calculated when you come to pay. Groceries and a variety of other \"necessities\" are usually exempt, but almost any other retail transaction – including restaurant meals – will incur sales tax.\n\nRegional price variations, indirect hotel and business taxes, etc. will usually have more impact on a traveler's wallet than the savings of seeking out a low-sales-tax or no-sales-tax destination. Many cities also impose sales taxes, and certain cities have tax zones near airports and business districts that are designed to exploit travelers. Thus, sales taxes can vary up to 2% in a matter of a few miles.\n\nHowever, even accounting for the burden of sales taxes, U.S. retail prices still tend to be much lower than in many other countries.  The U.S. has not implemented any form of value-added tax, where each segment in the supply chain is required to charge tax on the value it adds towards the final product.  Rather, U.S. sales taxes are charged ",{"type":"''","value":["only"]}," by the retailer at the time of the sale of the final product to the consumer.\n\nInternationally renowned luxury brands are hard to find in the no-sales-tax states.

America is the birthplace of the modern enclosed \"shopping mall\" as well as the open-air \"shopping center\".  In addition, American suburbs have miles and miles of small ",{"type":"'''","value":["strip malls"]},", or long rows of small shops with shared parking lots, usually built along a high-capacity road.  Large cities still maintain central shopping districts that can be navigated on public transport, but pedestrian-friendly shopping streets are uncommon and usually small.  Most medium-sized suburban towns contain at least one shopping mall containing one or more department stores as well as restaurants and retail establishments.  They also contain one or more strip corridors containing strip malls, auto dealerships, and office space.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Outlet centers"]},".  The U.S. pioneered the factory outlet store, and in turn, the outlet center, a shopping mall consisting primarily of such stores.  Outlet centers are found along major Interstate highways outside of most American cities.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Major retailers"]},".  American retailers tend to have some of the longest business hours in the world, with chains like Walmart and 7-Eleven often featuring stores open 24\/7 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week).  Department stores and other large retailers are usually open from 10AM to 9PM most days, and during the winter holiday season, may stay open as long as 8AM to 11PM.  Most supermarkets are open late into the evening, usually until at least 9PM.  The U.S. does not regulate the timing of sales promotions as in other countries.  U.S. retailers often announce sales during all major holidays, and also in between to attract customers or jettison merchandise.  American retail stores are gigantic compared to retail stores in other countries, and are a shoppers' dream come true.  As such, they typically offer a wide range of items.  Department stores typically sell clothing, shoes, furniture, perfume and jewelry.  Supermarkets sell produce, meats, fish, paper products, canned goods, milk, liquor and cigarettes.  In poor neighborhoods or on freeways adjacent to gas stations, there are often convenience stores that offer a small range of cooked food, soda, sundries and cigarettes, albeit at rates not competitive with supermarkets.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Farmer's markets"]},".  Unlike many other countries, the United States does not have large open-air markets open daily.  Instead, urban and suburban cities have farmer's markets where growers sell fruits and vegetables directly to consumers.  These events are typically held once weekly and take place in a cordoned-off street or parking lot.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Garage sales"]},". On weekends, it is not uncommon to find families selling no longer needed household items in their driveway, garage, or yard.  If you see a driveway full of stuff on a Saturday, it's likely a garage sale.  Check it out; one person's trash may just be your treasure.  Bargaining is expected and encouraged.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Flea markets"]},". Flea markets (called \"swap meets\" in Western states) have dozens if not hundreds of vendors selling all kinds of usually inexpensive merchandise.  They sometimes take place in convention centers, but usually take place in large suburban parking lots.  Some flea markets are highly specialized and aimed at collectors of a particular sort; others just sell all types of items.  Again, bargaining is expected.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Auctions"]},". Americans did not invent the auction but may well have perfected it.  The fast paced, sing-song cadence of a country auctioneer, selling anything from farm animals to estate furniture, is a special experience, even if you have no intention of buying.  In big cities, head to the auction chambers of Christie's or Sotheby's, and watch paintings, antiques and works of art sold in a matter of minutes at prices that go into the millions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Major U.S. retail chains"]},"\nAccording to Deloitte, the largest fashion goods retailer in both the U.S. and the entire world is Macy's, Inc., which operates over 800 Macy's midrange department stores in 45 states, Puerto Rico, and Guam, plus a smaller number of upscale Bloomingdale's stores. Nordstrom is another upscale department store that is also found in most states. Midrange stores include Kohl's, Sears, The Gap, and JCPenney, while the lower end is dominated by Marshalls, TJ Maxx, and Old Navy.  Department stores are normally found in suburban towns, often in shopping malls, though a few can be found in downtowns or smaller rural towns.\n\nGeneral discount stores like Walmart, Target, and Kmart are ubiquitous. Many discount stores, in addition to selling clothing and sundries, have either a small grocery section or a full supermarket; in fact, Walmart is the country's largest grocer, as well as being its largest retail chain.  The three largest supermarket chains are Kroger, Safeway, and SuperValu, but they operate under legacy regional nameplates in many states (for example, Vons and Ralphs in California, and Cub in Minnesota).  There are smaller regional supermarkets such as the A&P on the East Coast and Albertsons in the Rocky Mountain States.  A number of American suburbs have high-end markets such as Whole Foods that sell more expensive items such as wine and organic produce. The dominant warehouse club chain is Costco, whose biggest competitor is Sam's Club (operated by Walmart). The three big pharmacy chains are CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid, though almost all discount stores and many supermarkets also contain a small pharmacy. Most urban and suburban towns contain several supermarkets or pharmacies, and more often than not a Walmart or other “big box” retailer.\n\nA special note on pharmacies in discount stores and supermarkets: Generally, discount stores will group many items sold at pharmacies—over-the-counter medications, dental care products, cosmetics, hair care supplies, soap, first aid supplies, and the like—in one section of the store near the pharmacy counter. This is not the case in many supermarkets; these items are often split among two or more areas of the store. (Walmart uses the discount-store pharmacy model both in its discount stores and its supermarket-only Walmart Markets.)\n\nIn several areas of the retail sector, ruthless consolidation has resulted in only one surviving nationwide chain, which may compete with a number of smaller regional chains.  Examples include bookstores (Barnes & Noble), electronics (Best Buy), convenience stores (7-Eleven) and housewares (Bed Bath & Beyond).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Costs"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Bald Eagles Homer Alaska USA.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Bald Eagles in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Homer"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alaska"]]}]]},"\nUnless you live in Australia, Canada, Europe or Japan, the U.S. is generally ",{"type":"'''","value":["expensive"]},", but there are ways to limit the damage. Many Europeans come to the U.S. for shopping (especially electronics). While prices in the U.S. are lower than in many European countries, keep in mind that you will be charged taxes\/tariffs on goods purchased abroad. Additionally, electronics may not be compatible with standards when you return (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Electrical systems"],["electrical, DVD region"]]},", etc.). As such, the savings you may find shopping in the U.S. may easily be negated upon your return. Furthermore, your U.S.-bought item may not be eligible for warranty service in your home country.\n\nA bare bones budget for camping, hostels, and cooking your food could be $30–50\/day, and you can double that if you stay at motels and eat at cheap cafés. Add on a rental car and hotel accommodation and you'll be looking at $150\/day and up. There are regional variations too: large cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"],["New York"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles"]]}," are expensive, while prices go down in rural areas.  Most U.S. cities have suburbs with good hotels that are often much more affordable than those in the city center and enjoy lower crime rates.  Thus, if you plan to rent a car and drive between several major cities on a single visit to the U.S., it is usually a better idea to stay at safe suburban hotels with free parking, as opposed to downtown hotels that charge exorbitant parking fees.  Additionally, if you have generous friends from the U.S. who will give gift cards to you for some reason, the cards can help you defray some of the costs.\n\nIf you intend to visit any of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States National Parks"],["National Park Service"]]}," sites, such as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Canyon"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yellowstone National Park"]]},", it is worth considering the purchase of a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/fees_passes.htm National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass"]},".

You can trade in receipts from individual entries for 14 days at the entrance to the parks to upgrade to an annual pass, if you find yourself cruising around and ending up visiting more parks than expected.\n\nMany hotels and motels offer discounts for members of certain organizations which anyone can join, such as AAA (formerly the American Automobile Association). If you're a member, or are a member of a club affiliated with AAA (such as the Canadian Automobile Association, The Automobile Association in the UK, or ADAC in Germany), it's worth asking at check-in.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tipping"]},"\nTipping in America is widely used and expected.

Always tip more for better service (for example, if the cabbie helps you with your bags or stroller). Leave a small tip if the service is lousy (for example, if the cabbie refuses to turn on the AC on a hot day). For livery cabs, if you hail the cab on the street and negotiate the fare in advance, then pay the negotiated amount plus an extra $1–2."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Full-service restaurants: 15–20%.

Thus, in restaurants (and certain other professions) a tip is not just a way to say \"thank you\" for service, but is an essential part of a server's wages.\n\nRemember that while it is expected for you to tip normally for adequate service, you are never obliged to tip if your service was truly awful.  If you receive exceptionally poor or rude service and the manager does not correct the problem when you bring it to their attention, a deliberately small tip (one or two coins) will express your displeasure more clearly than leaving no tip at all.\n\nIf paying your bill by cash, leave a cash tip on the table when you leave (there is no need to hand it over personally or wait until it's collected), or if paying by credit card you can add it directly to the charge slip when you sign it. Look carefully, as the slip will generally inform you whether a 15% gratuity has already been added.\n\nTipping is not expected at restaurants where patrons stand at a counter to place their order and receive their food (such as fast-food chains). Some such restaurants may have a \"tip jar\" by the cash register, which may be used wholly at the customer's discretion in appreciation of good service. Some tipping at a cafeteria or buffet is expected since the wait staff often clears the table for you and provides refills of drinks and such.\n\nThe majority of jobs not mentioned here are not customarily tipped, and would likely refuse them.

In a major city such as New York, it may be possible to find a restaurant from nearly every country in the world. In addition to the usual array of independent restaurants, the U.S. possesses a singularly baffling array of fast food and casual chain restaurants; even if you think you know U.S. fast food from the chains' international outlets, the sheer variety domestically is immense.\n\nEthnic cuisine from other parts of the world is frequently adapted to American tastes and\/or made with locally available ingredients.  This is particularly true of Asian cuisines, especially Chinese (see below).\n\nMany restaurants, especially those serving fast food or breakfast, do not serve alcohol, and many others may only serve beer and wine. Portions are generally huge, regardless of restaurant style, although this trend has moderated recently with increasingly health-conscious customers. Many restaurants now offer several portion options, though it may not be immediately obvious. Ask when ordering if portion choices are available. Taking home \"left overs\" is very common and is a good way to get two meals for the price of one. Ask for a to-go box at the end of your meal if you have not cleared your plate.\n\nIn much of America, home-cooked food is substantially better than restaurant fare.

You may want to ask the people around you whether they mind before lighting up.

Alcoholic beverages are not served in these restaurants; \"soda\" (often called \"pop\" in the Midwest through Western New York and Western Pennsylvania, or generically \"coke\" in the South) or other soft drinks are standard. Don't be surprised when you order a soda, are handed a paper cup and expected to fill it yourself from the soda fountain (refills are often free). The quality of the food varies, but because of the strictly limited menu, it is generally good, especially in the daytime. Also the restaurants are usually clean and bright, and the service is limited but friendly. Tipping is not expected but you must clear your table after your meal. A few restaurants, called ",{"type":"'''","value":["\"drive-ins\""]},", serve you directly in your car.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Takeout"]}," food is very common in larger cities for meals that may take a little longer to prepare than in a fast-food place.

Many places will also deliver; in some cities, it is easier to have pizza or Chinese food delivered than to find a sit-down restaurant. Pizza delivery is especially ubiquitous in the U.S.; towns as small as 5,000 typically have at least one establishment offering delivery, and often more than one. The main national pizza chains are Pizza Hut (mostly dine-in restaurants that also offer takeout and delivery), Domino's (no dine-in), Papa John's (also no dine-in), and Little Caesars (mostly takeout only, with some locations also offering delivery). Local pizza places often compete successfully against the big national chains, and many such restaurants also offer takeout and delivery.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Fast-Casual"]}," restaurants offer a fast-food dining style (no waitstaff, no alcohol), but the meals tend to be fresher and healthier.

Like most other meals, quality and price can vary by restaurant.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Types of food"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Cheeseburger.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["A cheeseburger, or a hamburger with cheese"]]},"\nTypical American food items that can be found at most restaurants or large gatherings include hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, ice cream, and pie.  While many types of food are unchanged throughout the United States, there are a few distinct regional varieties of food. The most notable is in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South (United States of America)"],["South"]]},", where traditional local fare includes grits (ground maize porridge), collard greens (a boiled vegetable, often flavored with ham and a dash of vinegar), sweet iced tea, barbecue (not unique to this region, but best and most common here), catfish (served deep-fried with a breadcrumb coating), cornbread, okra, red beans, and gumbo (a stew of seafood or sausage, rice, okra, and sometimes tomatoes).\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Tips n slaw.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Rib tips in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Memphis"]]}]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Barbecue"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["BBQ"]},", or ",{"type":"'''","value":["barbeque"]}," is a delicious American specialty.  At its best, it's beef brisket, ribs, or pork shoulder slowly wood smoked for hours. Ribs are served as a whole- or half-rack or cut into individual ribs, brisket is usually sliced thin, and the pork shoulder can be shredded (\"pulled pork\") or chopped (\"chopped pork\").  Sauces of varying spiciness may be served on the dish, or provided on the side. There are also unique regional styles of barbecue, with the best generally found in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South (United States of America)"],["South"]]},". The most distinct styles come from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kansas City"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Texas"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tennessee"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Carolina"]]},".  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["California"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maryland"]]}," have a style that focuses on beef barbecued in an outdoor pit or brick oven. However, barbecue of some variety is generally available throughout the country.  Barbecued meat can be served with a variety of sides, including chili, corn on the cob, coleslaw and potato salad. Barbecue restaurants are unpretentious and the best food is often found at very casual establishments. Expect plastic dinnerware, picnic tables, and sandwiches on cheap white bread. Barbecue found on the menu at a fancy chain or non-specialty restaurant is likely to be less authentic. Ribs and chicken are almost always eaten with your fingers; tackle pork and brisket either with a fork or in a sandwich. Some Americans (though never Southerners) use \"barbecue\" as a synonym for \"cookout\": a party where the likes of chicken, hamburgers, and hot dogs are grilled outdoors (rather than smoked).  These can be fun, but they don't represent the American BBQ cuisine.\n\nWith a rich tradition of immigration, America has a wide variety of ",{"type":"'''","value":["ethnic foods"]},"; everything from Ethiopian cuisine to Laotian food is available in major cities with large immigrant populations.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Italian food"]}," is perhaps the most pervasive of ethnic cuisines in America, though this food has often taken a different direction than Italian food in Italy.  All but the smallest villages have at least one restaurant that specializes in pizza, and many also have pasta restaurants as well.  There are also restaurants that specialize in ",{"type":"'''","value":["German"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["French"]}," food, but in much smaller numbers.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Chinese food"]}," is widely available and adjusted to American tastes.  Authentic Chinese food can be found in restaurants in Chinatowns in addition to communities with large Chinese populations. Japanese ",{"type":"'''","value":["sushi"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vietnamese"]},", and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Thai food"]}," have also been adapted for the American market in recent years. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fusion"]}," cuisine combines Asian ingredients and techniques with more traditional American presentation. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Indian food"]}," outlets are available in most major U.S. cities and towns.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mexican\/Hispanic\/Tex-Mex food"]}," is very popular, but again in a localized version. Combining in various ways beans, rice, cheese, and spiced beef or chicken with round flatbread loaves called ",{"type":"''","value":["tortillas"]},", dishes are usually topped with spicy tomato ",{"type":"''","value":["salsa"]},", sour cream, and an avocado-based dip called ",{"type":"''","value":["guacamole"]},". Small authentic Mexican ",{"type":"''","value":["taquerias"]}," can be found easily in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["California"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southwest (United States of America)"],["Southwest"]]},", and increasingly in cities throughout the country.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Middle Eastern"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Greek"]}," foods are also becoming popular in the United States. The ",{"type":"''","value":["gyro"]}," (known as \"doner kebab\" or \"shawarma\" in Europe) is a popular Greek sandwich of sliced processed lamb on a pita bread topped with lettuce, tomatoes and a yogurt-cucumber sauce. ",{"type":"''","value":["Hummus"]}," (a ground chickpea dip\/spread) and ",{"type":"''","value":["baklava"]}," pastries are frequently found in supermarkets, along with an increasingly widespread and high-quality array of \"pita\" products.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Vegetarian food"]}," is easy to come by in big urban areas. As vegetarians are becoming more common in the U.S., so are the restaurants that cater to them. Most big cities and college towns will have vegetarian restaurants serving exclusively or primarily vegetarian dishes. In smaller towns you may need to check the menu at several restaurants before finding a vegetarian main course, or else make up a meal out of side dishes. Wait staff can be helpful answering questions about meat content, but be very clear about your personal definition of vegetarian, as dishes with fish, chicken, egg, or even small quantities of beef or pork flavoring may be considered vegetarian. This is especially common with vegetable side dishes in the South. Meat-free breakfast foods such as pancakes or eggs are readily available at diners.\n\nPeople on low-fat or low-calorie diets should be fairly well-served in the U.S., as there has been a continuing trend in ",{"type":"'''","value":["calorie consciousness"]}," since the 1970s. Even fast-food restaurants have \"lite\" specials, and can provide charts of calorie and fat counts on request.\n\nFor the ",{"type":"''","value":["backpacker"]}," or those on ",{"type":"''","value":["very restricted budgets"]},", American ",{"type":"'''","value":["supermarkets"]}," offer an almost infinite variety of ",{"type":"''","value":["pre-packaged"]},"\/",{"type":"''","value":["pre-processed"]}," foods that are either ready or almost ready for consumption, e.g. breakfast cereal, ramen noodles, canned soups, frozen dinner, etc.\n\nIn the largest cities, \"corner stores\" abound. These small convenience stores carry a variety of snacks, drinks, and prepackaged foods. Unlike most convenience stores, their products are sold at relatively low prices (especially by urban standards) and can provide for snacks or even (nutritionally partial) meals for a budget no more than $5 a day.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Etiquette"]},"\nIt is usually inappropriate to join a table already occupied by other diners, even if it has unused seats; Americans prefer this degree of privacy when they eat.  Exceptions are cafeteria-style eateries with long tables, at crowded informal eateries and cafés you may have success asking a stranger if you can share the table they're sitting at, and at some inexpensive Chinese restaurants where staff will direct you to share a table.  Striking up a conversation in this situation may or may not be welcome, however.\n\nTable manners, while varying greatly, are typically European-influenced. Slurping or making other noises while eating is considered rude, as is loud conversation (including phone calls). It is fairly common to wait until everybody at your table has been served before eating. You should lay cloth napkins across your lap; you can do the same with paper napkins, or keep them on the table. Offense isn't taken if you don't finish your meal, and most restaurants will package the remainder to take with you, or provide a box for you to do this yourself (sometimes euphemistically called a \"doggy bag\", implying that the leftovers are for your pet). If you want to do this, ask the server to get the remainder \"to go\"; this term will be almost universally understood, and will not cause any embarrassment. Some restaurants offer an \"all-you-can-eat\" buffet or other service; taking home portions from such a meal is either not allowed, or carries an additional fee.\n\nMany fast food items (sandwiches, burgers, pizza, tacos, etc.) are designed to be eaten by hand (so-called \"finger food\"); a few foods are almost always eaten by hand (french fries, barbecue, chicken on the bone) even at moderately nice restaurants. If unsure, eating finger food with a fork and knife probably won't offend anyone; eating fork-and-knife food by hand might, as it's considered \"uncivilized\" and rude.\n\nWhen invited to a meal in a private home it is considered polite for a guest to ask if they can bring anything for the meal, such a dessert, a side dish, wine or beer, or for an outdoor barbecue, something useful like ice or plastic cups or plates. The host may refuse, but it is nonetheless considered good manners to bring along a small gift for the host. A bottle of wine, box of candies or fresh cut flowers are most common. Gifts of cash, prepared ready-to-serve foods, or very personal items (e.g. toiletries) are not appropriate. If you do not know your hosts very well, it may be best to avoid alcohol in certain situations, as many Americans drink alcohol very infrequently or not at all. This teetotaling is found particularly in the Bible Belt (the South and parts of the Midwest), and the Mormon Belt (Utah and to a lesser extent Idaho, Wyoming, and Arizona): Mormons, some Fundamentalist Christians and Muslims are forbidden by their religions to drink alcohol at all.\n\nAn exception is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["carry-in"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["potluck"]}," meal, where each guest (or group\/family) must bring a food dish to share with everyone; these shared dishes make up the entire meal. Usually dishes are grouped (e.g., salads, main dishes or casseroles, side dishes, desserts); you should ask the host if they want you to bring something in particular. Ideal dishes for a potluck should be served from a large ",{"type":"''","value":["pot"]},", dish, or bowl, and would be spooned or forked on to diners' plates—hence the emphasis on salads, casseroles, and spoonable side dishes.  These types of meals typically offer a wide assortment of well-prepared foods and may be the very best way to experience authentic American cuisine.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Bourbon.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["America's native spirit — bourbon, straight up"]]},"\n\nDrinking customs in America are as varied as the backgrounds of its many people.  In the cities, you can find everything from tough local \"shot and a beer\" bars to upscale \"martini bars\"; urban bars and nightclubs will often serve only simple food, or none at all. In the suburbs, alcohol is mainly served in restaurants rather than bars.  And in rural areas, the line between \"bar\" and \"restaurant\" is often blurred to the point of meaninglessness; with few establishments nearby, locals go to the same place for both meals and nightlife.  A few states have ",{"type":"'''","value":["dry counties"]},", places where it is illegal to sell alcohol for local consumption; these are mostly in rural areas.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Laws"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The drinking age is 21 throughout the U.S."]}," except in most of the outlying territories (where it is 18). Enforcement of this varies, but if you're under 30 be prepared to show photo ID. Some retailers may not accept a foreign driver's license (except from Canada) so having your passport available when purchasing alcohol is strongly advised. In some states, people who are under 21 are not even allowed to be present in a bar or liquor store.\n\nAlcohol sales are typically prohibited after 2AM. In some states, most stores can only sell beer and wine; hard liquor is sold at dedicated liquor stores.  Several \"dry counties\" – mostly in southern states – ban some or all types of alcohol in public establishments; private clubs (with nominal membership fees) are often set up to get around this.  Sunday sales are restricted in some areas.\n\nMost towns ban drinking in the open with varying degrees of enforcement. Even if it is allowed, a visible bottle (rather than one in a small bag) is either illegal or justifies police attention. Being \"drunk and disorderly\" is banned. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Drunk driving"]}," comes under fairly harsh scrutiny. A blood-alcohol level of 0.08% is considered \"under the Influence\" and many states consider a level of 0.05% as \"impaired\". If you're under 21, most states have limits of 0.00-0.02%. Foreigners will typically be deported, even well established permanent residents. It is also usually against the law to have an open container of alcohol anywhere in a car other than in the trunk; this can be heavily fined. Should you find yourself in a situation where you drank a bit more than you intended and are unsure if you should drive, taxi cabs are fairly prolific in medium to large cities. Many automotive clubs offer hotlines to find a ride home.\n\nSales of ",{"type":"'''","value":["raw milk"]}," for human consumption are illegal in some states and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) bans the interstate sale or distribution of raw milk.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Drinks"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Beer"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["wine"]}," are the main non-distilled alcoholic drinks, with ",{"type":"'''","value":["whiskey"]}," the main ",{"type":"''","value":["hard liquor"]}," (i.e. distilled drink). \"Cider\" without further qualification is just an unfiltered variety of apple juice. \"Hard cider\" is the alcoholic drink from fermented apples; it is generally unpopular despite Americans having been its most enthusiastic consumers two centuries ago.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Beer"]}," constitutes approximately half the alcohol consumed in the U.S. Nationally known light lagers (which are cheap and mediocre) remain most prevalent, despite the emergence of other types of beer in the 1990s. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Microbreweries"]},", which specialize in small-batch, high-quality beers made by traditional methods, add much-needed variety. Microbrews are often inventive and experimental; some are excellent examples of classic beer styles, while others push the limits and develop new, unique flavors.

American wines are labeled primarily by the grape variety. A rough guide to quality comes in the specificity of the labeling. Color alone (\"Red\", \"white\", and \"rosé\" or \"pink\") denotes the lowest echelon. Above this, regions are labeled by state (e.g. \"California\"), an area of a state (e.g. \"Central Coast\"), a county or other small region (e.g. \"Willamette Valley\"), or a specific vineyard (e.g. \"Dry Creek Vineyard\").\n\nThe cheapest wine tends to come in a plastic bag encased in a box. \"Fortified wines\", known as \"bum wine\", are the precise opposite of high-class European port, sherry or Madeira.\n\nAll 50 states practice some sort of winemaking, though 90% of America's wine—including its most highly regarded from the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Napa Valley"]]}]},"—are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Californian"]},".

The best Californian sparkling wines have been rated comparably to leading French champagnes but they are not commonly sold in supermarkets outside of California.\n\nMost bars, except urbane wine bars, serve unremarkable wine. Wine is taken quite seriously by some restaurants, but as with all other alcoholic drinks in restaurants, expect to pay up to four times the liquor store price for a bottle.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hard alcohol"]}," (i.e. spirits) is usually drunk with mixers, but it is also served \"on the rocks\" (with ice) or \"straight up\" (unmixed, with no ice, also called \"neat\").

Reservations are typically unnecessary, which is convenient since you don't have to arbitrarily interrupt a long road trip; you can simply drive until you're tired then find a room. However, some are used by adults looking to book a night for sex or illicit activities and many are located in undesirable areas.\n\nBusiness or extended-stay hotels are increasingly available across the country. They can be found in smaller towns across the Midwest or in coastal urban areas. Generally they are more expensive than motels, but not as expensive as full-scale hotels, with prices around $70 to $170.  While the hotels may appear to be the size of a motel, they may offer amenities from larger hotels. Examples include Marriott's Courtyard by Marriott, Fairfield Inns, and Residence Inns; Hilton's Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn; Holiday Inn's Holiday Inn Express; Starwood's Four Points by Sheraton, and Hyatt Place.\n\nSome extended-stay hotels are directed at business travelers or families on long-term stays (that are often relocating due to corporate decisions).  These hotels often feature kitchens in most rooms, afternoon social events (generally by a pool), and serve continental breakfast.  Such \"suite\" hotels are roughly equivalent to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["serviced apartments"]}," seen in other countries, though the term \"serviced apartments\" is not generally used in American English.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hotels"]}," are available in most cities and usually offer more services and amenities than motels.

Check-in and check-out times are almost always fall in the range of 11AM-noon and 2PM-4PM. Many U.S. cities now have \"edge cities\" in their suburbs which feature high-quality upscale hotels aimed at affluent business travelers.  These hotels often feature all the amenities of their downtown\/CBD cousins (and more), but at less exorbitant prices.\n\nIn many rural areas, especially on the coasts and in New England, ",{"type":"'''","value":["bed and breakfast"]}," (B&B) lodging can be found. Usually in converted houses or buildings with less than a dozen units, B&Bs feature a more home-like lodging experience, with free breakfast served (of varying quality and complexity). Bed and breakfasts range from about $50 to $200 per night, with some places being much steeper. They can be a nice break from the impersonality of chain hotels and motels.  Unlike Europe, most American bed and breakfasts are unmarked; one must make a reservation beforehand and receive directions there.\n\nThe two best-known hotel guides covering the U.S. are the AAA (formerly American Automobile Association; typically pronounced \"Triple-A\") TourBooks, available to members and affiliated auto clubs worldwide at local AAA offices; and the Mobil Travel Guide, available at bookstores. There are several websites booking hotels online; be aware that many of these sites add a small commission to the room rate, so it may be cheaper to book directly through the hotel.  On the other hand, some hotels charge more for \"drop-in\" business than reserved rooms or rooms acquired through agents and brokers, so it's worth checking both.\n\nThere are also ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hostels"],["youth hostels"]]}]}," across the U.S.  Most are affiliated with the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hiayh.org\/ American Youth Hostel"]}," organization (a Hostelling International member).

The latter is usually easiest; the two institutions will handle much of the arrangements, and you don't have to make a commitment to four years living in a strange country.

On the other hand, there is the more permanent employment-based immigrant visa which has similar requirements to the H-1B visa.

Crime is usually connected with gangs and drugs in the inner cities, and with heated disputes. Avoid those and you'll be fine. Urban tourist areas are heavily policed and are safe from all but petty crimes.\n\nUrban areas tend to have homeless people who may aggressively ask for money.

Most minor traffic infractions can be paid by mail. Increasingly fines can be paid online or over the phone within a matter of minutes of receiving the ticket, though often for a convenience fee of a few dollars. Instructions are often printed on the ticket.\n\nThere are three types of police you are most likely to encounter: state police\/highway patrol units on state highways, deputy sheriffs employed by county governments in rural areas, and police officers employed by city or town governments in urban areas.  Some transit agencies in major cities have their own transit police departments separate from city or county law enforcement.  Federal law enforcement officers are generally found only in or near federal facilities, such as ports of entry.  If you encounter them elsewhere, it is usually because they are investigating specific allegations of federal crimes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Emergency services"]},"\n\nDialing ",{"type":"'''","value":["9-1-1"]}," at any telephone will reach the emergency services (police, fire, ambulance, etc.). Any U.S. phone, regardless if it is \"active\" or not, must be able to dial 911 if it is connected to the network, and such calls are always free. Unless you are calling from a mobile or Internet-based phone, the operator should be able to locate you from the phone you are using even if you do not say anything.  Modern cell phones will send a GPS fix of your location down to a few meters within a few seconds of dialing 911. Dialing 911 and leaving an open line will bring all 3 emergency services to your location in under 5 minutes in most populated areas. Response time may be longer in sparsely populated areas or along the Interstates.\n\nOn any GSM mobile phone (the standard technology in most of the world, especially in Europe), you can also dial ",{"type":"'''","value":["112"]},", which is the standard emergency number for GSM networks worldwide. U.S. GSM carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, and smaller regional operators) automatically redirect 112 calls to 911.\n\nAs in most countries, misuse of the emergency services number will result in, at the least, a call back from authorities; at most, arrest. If you reach 9-1-1 accidentally (for instance, if a misdial of the 011- international prefix gets a \"9-1-1, what's your emergency?\" response) stay on the line for long enough to explain to the dispatcher that you have reached a wrong number.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Border Patrol"]},"\n\nThe United States Border Patrol works near both the Canadian and the Mexican borders, as well as in Southern coastal areas like the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florida Keys"]]},". They can verify immigration status and enforce immigration laws in the \"border zones\"—generally within 40 miles of Canada and 75 miles of Mexico (although the law allows for 100 miles from any border, including sea and the Great Lakes). Near Canada they tend to be unobtrusive and generally focus their work on long-distance buses and trains. In the South, systematic vehicle checkpoints or being stopped on the street with a friendly \"Papers, please...\" is much more likely. They tend not to target tourists specifically.\n\nForeigners are always required to carry their passports, visas, and landing cards (or Green Cards). Being found without them near the border could lead you to being detained until your status is verified, or possibly fined. If your documents are in order, you generally won't be questioned. In most states (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arizona"]]}," is a notable exception), police and other local authorities are not allowed to question you about your immigration status or to ask to see your passport or visa unless you're arrested and charged with a crime, and then only for the purpose of connecting you with your embassy.

It has a very distinctive electronic screeching followed by a sound similar to a dial tone prior to any message. It will override AM\/FM radio broadcasts as well as TV systems. Smartphones sold since about 2011 will often receive the alert as well in the form of a message based on the current location of the phone (depending on the phone's settings, this may include a loud alert tone). In most tornado-prone regions, a system of sirens will sound when a tornado warning is issued. If you hear the siren, seek shelter immediately.

Marriage laws vary from state to state; currently 15 states and the District of Columbia allow and recognize same-sex marriages, while a handful others provide some benefits without calling them \"marriages\".  In these states, foreign marriages will likely be recognized.  The federal government, due to a 2013 court case, now also recognizes same-sex marriages including foreign marriages.\n\nIn general, the US is a safe destination for gay and lesbian travellers, though as a whole, homosexuality is somewhat not as well accepted as in Australia, Canada or Western Europe. Most Americans take a live-and-let-live approach to sexuality, but there are significant exceptions. It's generally not a problem to be open about your sexual orientation, though you may receive unwanted attention or remarks in some situations. Attitudes toward homosexuality vary widely even in regions with a reputation for tolerance or intolerance. Acceptance is most common in major cities throughout the country and smaller cities, suburbs and college towns especially around the Pacific Coast, the Northeast and Hawaii, with acceptance in these areas generally being on par with Western Europe. Homophobia and anti-gay violence may be encountered anywhere, especially in some suburban and rural areas of the Southeast and interior West, but the chances of this happening to you are low.\n\nGay-friendly destinations, where openly gay couples are common, include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"],["New York"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manhattan\/Chelsea"],["Chelsea"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rochester (New York)"],["Rochester"]]}," in Western ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York State"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Lakeview-North Center"],["Boystown"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seattle"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seattle\/Capitol Hill-Central District"],["Capitol Hill"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco\/Castro-Noe Valley"],["Castro Street"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C."],["Washington"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington (D.C.)\/Dupont Circle"],["Dupont Circle"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Miami Beach"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Miami\/South Beach"],["South Beach"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Atlanta"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Atlanta\/Midtown"],["Midtown"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles"]]},"' ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Hollywood"]]},".

A gay American man is 44 times more likely to contract HIV than a heterosexual one, and 46 times more likely to contract syphilis. This risk grows greatly among men likely to engage in one-night stands and other higher-risk behavior. In a nation where 0.5% of the population are infected with HIV, unprotected sex is a very real risk. Precautions, including safer sex, are strongly advised during your stay. Most cities have affordable or free testing and treatment centers for STIs, though hours may be limited and waits may be long. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.plannedparenthood.org\/ Planned Parenthood"]}," clinics are often an affordable alternative.
