Following an acquisition by MCA (Music Corporation of America), staff accountants suggested that a studio bus tour of the massive backlot and a stop at the commissary would boost profits.  The famous backlot tram ride at the park today is a direct descendant.\n\nIn 1964, the humble tour was expanded to include staged events that are similar to the Wild West stunt show which closed in 2000.  In the 1980s a large scale, motion picture themed amusement park evolved to accompany the tour.\n\nIn the 1990s, the extremely innovative City Walk was unveiled, an entertainment\/shopping center that redefined the concept of an urban mall.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nUniversal City is just four miles south of Burbank's ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bob Hope Airport"]}," and about 45 minutes to Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nUniversal City has its own exit from the 101 Freeway traveling northbound from downtown Los Angeles.
