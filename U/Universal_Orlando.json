Many visitors describe it as a place of fun, action, magic, excitement, humor, wonder, fantasy and attention to detail.\n\nWhen guests exit the parking garage, they are first welcomed into the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Universal CityWalk Orlando"]}," entertainment district. Then guests can see the two theme parks ",{"type":"'''","value":["Universal Studios Florida"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Islands of Adventure"]},". Universal Orlando's waterpark is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wet 'n Wild Orlando"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Universal CityWalk Orlando"]}," opened in 1999. Guests arriving at the resort park in one of two multi-story parking structures, then travel via covered moving sidewalks over Universal Boulevard and into CityWalk. From there, guests can proceed into either of the theme parks, Universal Studios Florida or Islands of Adventure. CityWalk features shopping, nightclubs, and dining venues, and AMC Movie Theater. Universal Store has all the merchandise from both parks and Margaritaville has a gift shop. There are many night clubs at CityWalk most popular is the Groove, which has recently taken away 80's night.  Red Coconut Club is the first club up the stairs on the right. Bob Marley-A Tribute to Freedom is both a night club and dining, Live Reggae & Jamaican Cuisine. Some notable locations are Hard Rock Cafe, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, NASCAR Sports Grill, Emeril's, NBA City, Bubba gump shrimp company, Antojitos and Red Oven Pizza Bakery. There are also casual dining places at CityWalk: Moe's Southwest Grill, Burger King Whopper Bar, Panda express, Fusion Bistro Sushi & Sake Bar. CityWalk also features a Blue Man Group show at the Sharp Aquos Theater.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Universal Studios Florida"]}," is a real, working film and TV production facility there are an array of rides, shows, movie sets and attractions. Visitors also enjoy themed dining and shopping, a variety of special events throughout the year, and you might even catch a real film crew at work on the backlot. Universal Studios Florida, opened on June 7, 1990, is a theme park that lets visitors \"Ride the Movies.\" The themes of Universal Studio's are targeted at making guests feel like they are in a movie set with rides, shows, and attractions that are inspired by popular film, television, and music productions. The park consists of seven themed areas – Hollywood, Production Central, New York, San Francisco, World Expo, Springfield and Woody Woodpecker's Kidzone.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Islands of Adventure"]},", opened May 28, 1999, is a theme park composed of seven distinct \"islands\" that are themed to various forms of adventures. Visitors start off in the Port of Entry and make their way through the various islands – Marvel Super Hero Island, Toon Lagoon, Jurassic Park, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, The Lost Continent, and Seuss Landing. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, based on the popular Harry Potter franchise, is the only island added after the park opened; it opened to the public on June 18, 2010\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Wet 'n Wild Orlando"]}," was founded in 1977 by SeaWorld founder George Millay. The park is considered one of the first major water parks. There are eighteen water slides and attractions at the water park divided into four categories: Thrill Rides, Multi-Person Rides, Kids Rides, and Other Attractions. Popular attractions include The Storm, Bomb Bay, Disco H20, The Surge, and more. Wet 'n Wild is located on International Drive in front of Sand Lake. In the mid 2000's the water park was acquired by Universal Parks & Resorts.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Universal Orlando's on-site hotels"]}," include: Loews Portofino Bay Hotel & Spa, Hard Rock Hotel, Loews Royal Pacific Hotel, and Cabana Bay Beach Resort. All four hotels are located in close proximity to the Universal Orlando theme parks. The hotels offer guests free water taxi or shuttle bus service to the Universal Orlando theme parks. Another benefit is that for all hotels but the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, the guest room key works as an \"Express Pass\", allowing the guest to bypass the Stand-by line at participating attractions. Theme park guests who are not staying at the Universal official hotels are able to purchase \"Express Passes\" at an additional cost.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["Universal Orlando"],["28.475"],["-81.47"]]},"\n\nLike all of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Florida"]]},", the climate at Universal Orlando is ",{"type":"'''","value":["humid and subtropical"]},".  Summer (May–October) is hot and sticky and winter (November–April) is mild and drier.  Visitors from higher latitudes are often surprised by the sheer ",{"type":"'''","value":["intensity of the summer sun"]}," in Florida, which can rise to within a few degrees of straight overhead in June and July.  In June through September, ",{"type":"'''","value":["late afternoon thundershowers"]}," are very common; plan accordingly.\n\nInclement weather can often lead to the temporary closure of outdoor rides and live performances. In the case of rides, they will re-open after the weather improves. Live performances may be either delayed or canceled outright. On the other hand, inclement weather could work to your advantage, as it drives some visitors away from outdoor areas, or out of the parks entirely.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["When to visit"]},"\n\nThere used to be some times of year when the parks were relatively deserted, but not so much anymore.  Now they just vary ",{"type":"'''","value":["from \"moderately busy\" to \"completely insane\""]},".  Still, deciding when to go remains a ",{"type":"'''","value":["game of trade-offs"]},": you must decide whether to favor lower crowds or longer park hours, and decide whether you prefer scorching days or chilly nights.\n\nThe peak periods for attendance are late December, mid-June to mid-August, and mid-February to mid-April.  Why?  That's when kids are ",{"type":"'''","value":["on break from school"]},".  If you have kids, you may have no choice but to go during these peak times.  The bad news is that you'll be packed like sardines next to 50,000 of your new closest friends, you'll wait two hours to go on rides like Forbidden Journey, Rip Ride Rockit, and Transformers, and you'll be paying a premium for the privilege.  In the summer, you also get to listen to the kids complain about the heat.  On the bright side, you'll have plenty of company, the parks are guaranteed to be open late, and almost every ride will be up and running.\n\nIf your schedule allows any flexibility at all, you should avoid these peak periods.  Attendance is lowest in October, November (pre-Thanksgiving), December (pre-Christmas), and January.  These can be very good times to go; crowds are low and prices are too, but keep in mind that you may find that several rides are shut down for maintenance, and the parks have shorter operating hours.  In the winter, it's often too cold to go to the water parks, and you'll need a jacket at night.\n\nThe weeks between Easter and Memorial Day are another slow period, as well as the months of August and September; both periods provide a good balance of price, crowds, temperature, and operating hours, but you may need to take the kids out of school if you're bringing them along.\n\nOf course, you may want to coordinate your trip with a ",{"type":"'''","value":["special event"]}," such as Halloween Horror Nights.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Timing"]},"\n\nIf your vacation dates are flexible, plan to arrive to the Orlando area on Thursday. Both Friday and Saturday are transition days for park visitors, especially in the summer months. Saturdays do draw in more Annual Pass holders to the park, but that is the major day that people either arrive or leave the area. This causes attendance figures to be down, making it a perfect day to visit the parks. \n\nIf you are planning to have a day of rest in your vacation, by arriving on Thursday you can enjoy two days of parks with reduced crowds and then use Sunday to rest. If during those first two days you are planning to visit the Magic Kingdom, plan to do it on Friday. Attendance figures pick up for that park on Saturday. You will be able to do more attractions in the first two days while you are revved up, and then it will allow you to relax and enjoy the park on the more crowded days.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nAs in most places in the United States, ",{"type":"'''","value":["English"]}," is the default language throughout the Universal Orlando Resort.

The main entrance building also has a large food court-like restaurant called the Bayliner Diner, as well as a Starbucks, the Swizzle Lounge, and a Universal Studios Store.  At the currently available pool, there's the Atomic Tonic bar; in the lazy river area, there'll be the Hideaway Bar & Grill."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["28.4748"],["-81.4679"],["zoom=15"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Orange County (Florida)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Universal Orlando"]]}]
