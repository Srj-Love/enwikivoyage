Many people visit the island primarily to see the bird cliffs where many thousands of pairs of seabirds nest, both on the landside cliffs and on the spectacular sea stacks.  There are more than 10,000 pairs of gannets and 25,000 pairs of puffins, together with guillemots, shags and fulmars.  Puffins nest in burrows rather than on the cliffs themselves and can be viewed up close.  The smell and the noise from the colonies of seabirds can be quite startling.  From the car park at the visitor's centre follow the main path into the nature reserve (which is gravel at this point).  After a few hundred yards you will see a turning on your right down a steep peat bank — do not take this as this is your return route.  Carrying straight on, the path turns to duckboards (note that not the entire path is covered and it can be very wet under foot).  Do not leave the path as Hermaness is a prime breeding ground for the Great Skua or 'Bonxie' and they can be aggressive.  Reaching the end of the path you can make a brief detour to your left to see the gannet colonies on the Neap, or right for a view of the lighthouse of Muckle Flugga and the desolate rock of the Out Stack (Britain's most northerly point).  Behind the Out Stack, Hermaness Hill rises steeply to a cairn with a final view due northwards, uninterrupted by further landmasses until the North Pole.  The path downwards to rejoin the original track is rough going (few duckboards here) and extremely marshy. Eventually you will descend to the gravel track and back to the car park.  There is a visitor's book sealed inside a plastic bag within a box with a rock on top here which can probably give you some indication of the extreme weather conditions that can be experienced in this area; reputedly the highest wind speed ever recorded in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"]]}," of 177 mph was recorded at Saxa Vord just across the voe, but was never verified because the anemometer blew away."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Burra Firth"]}," - This is the voe (sea-inlet) between the cliffs of Hermaness at one side, and Saxa Vord at the other.

Unst is famous for its unspoiled landscape, its Viking heritage, and particularly for its wildlife, including some of the largest colonies of seabirds in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]}," and a sizeable otter population.  The name 'Unst' is believed to come from the old Norse for 'Eagle's Nest', although unfortunately there are no longer any sea eagles in Shetland.  Although parts of the island are fairly uninspiring peat bogs, there is some truly spectacular coastal scenery and some excellent beaches.  Its population is around 700 people and has been on the decrease since the closing of the RAF base at Saxa Vord (which has now been converted into a resort with a hostel, self-catering accommodation and restaurant).  Significant efforts are proceeding to diversify the local economy into ventures such as alternative energy (the PURE Hydrogen project), tourism, and even the country's most northerly brewery.  Unst is the home of Shetland's only unique plant, the \"Shetland Mouse Ear\".  The majority of the roads on Unst are single track and unfenced, and it is important to watch out for sheep and for the many Shetland ponies, which, unlike elsewhere in Shetland, roam freely.  The author Robert Louis Stevenson visited Unst to visit his uncle who was responsible for the construction of the Muckle Flugga Lighthouse (and many others in Shetland), and it is said that the map of Treasure Island closely resembles that of Unst.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nUnst can be reached from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mainland (Shetland)"],["Mainland"]]}," by ferry via the island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yell"]]},".  It is possible to see at least the highlights of the island in one day, but requires an early start if leaving from Lerwick as it is a fairly long drive and includes two ferry trips each way.  Luckily the ferries run regularly from early in the morning until late at night, though note that certain less frequented trips will only run if there are prior bookings.  The first ferry (to Yell) leaves from Toft, 25 miles north of Lerwick.  Boards on the A970 just out of Lerwick give information on whether the ferries are running (which in the case of extreme weather they may not be).  Follow the signs to 'The North Isles' (one of the more endearing features on this road is at least one signpost marked 'The South - Lerwick').  The ferry terminals on this route are extremely basic, no more than a small waiting room with toilets and a timetable.  Allocation of space on the ferry for cars is by lane, with one being for pre-booked traffic which takes priority over other vehicles.  In spite of the instructions on the timetable it is seldom necessary to book except at peak periods or if you are especially paranoid. The ferry to Yell (Ulsta) takes around 20 minutes and you are able to leave your vehicle and go up to the observation deck where there are refreshment machines and a good view over the sound (with the possibility of whale spotting).  The ferries between Mainland\/Yell and Yell\/Fetlar\/Unst are coordinated so that you have time to drive at reasonable speed down the main road (A968) between Ulsta and Gutcher and have good time to catch the next ferry.  Note that the Bluemill Sound ferry between Yell and Unst also goes to Fetlar, so be sure to follow the signs and get into the correct lane.  The published timetable can be more than a little confusing but the staff are friendly and helpful, and it is actually more an issue if you are going to Fetlar as all the ferries call at Unst.  The journey across the Bluemill Sound to Unst only takes ten minutes, and the ferry is a smaller affair with no lounge, but it is still possible to leave your car for a little wildlife watching. Both ferries take foot passengers and it is possible to travel by integrated bus\/ferry Service 24) all the way from Lerwick, but note that there is only one bus a day (none on Sundays), so if you want to see anything of the island, this method would necessitate an overnight stay.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:unst.png"],["thumb"],["Map of Unst"]]},"\n\nThe main road on the island is the A968 which is two lane and well maintained.  Once off this road, the majority are single track with passing places, though typically for Shetland, also in good condition.  The exception to this is the road to Hermaness which is extremely narrow and steep.  It is essential to keep a keen eye out for sheep (particularly during the lambing season) and ponies because many of the roads are not fenced.  There is a basic bus service on the island with Service 28 buses running between Baltasound and Belmont six times a day (Monday to Saturday - no Sunday service).  A couple of these buses call at intermediary stops such as Haroldswick and Saxa Vord ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.zettrans.org.uk\/bus\/NorthIsles.asp#Unst Shetland Bus Timetables"]},".
