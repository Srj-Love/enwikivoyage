Exact details differ for each town - it is worthwhile consulting the article on each for full details.\n\nNegotiate with your taxi driver to stop in each of the towns along the way - this is a very common practice and can be easily arranged with some canny bargaining - but do note that although this part of the Nile Valley has never really been threatened by violence (unlike ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Middle Egypt"]]},") - the Egyptian tourist police may nonetheless insist that you travel within a police convoy.\n\nAlternatively, a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["felucca cruise on the Nile"]]}," between Luxor and Aswan will normally include stops at one or more of these Upper Egyptian towns.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Egypt"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["24.12"],["32.75"],["zoom=8"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Upper Egypt"]]}]
