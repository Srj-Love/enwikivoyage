The U.P. is, however, a real treasure to visit with much to offer to any nature lover! Plentiful sandy public beaches, breathtaking recreational and fishing lakes, and vast state and national parks and forests make the region an ideal location for a vacation in any season.

The population is primarily of Finnish or Swedish decent, and also includes populations of Menominee, Ojibwa Chippewa descent. You will also encounter many people with Italian or French names; the U.P. was first explored by the French, who built the first trading posts at Sault-Ste. Marie and St. Ignace in the 1600s, and named many of the earliest towns. The U.P. was dominated by the fur trade until the 1800s, at which time most towns were formed as mining or logging operations. While mining of copper, iron ore, and other minerals has dropped off since the mid-1900s, the lumber industry is still going strong. A good example of the heritage of the area is preserved at Fayette Historic State Park south on 183 from US-2.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["\"Say ya to da UP, eh?\""]},"  This is the UP's answer to the state tourism office's slogan \"Say Yes to Michigan!\"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Yoopers"]}," (inhabitants of Upper Michigan) have an accent with a Canada-meets-the-Midwest flavor.  \"Ya\" and \"eh\" are the most well-known of the colloquial slang.

From there, US 2 will take you from St. Ignace to Escanaba, along the northern coast of Lake Michigan.  Or, take M 28 via M 123 at St. Ignace; US 117 and M 77 are north-south routes connecting US 2 with M 28.   M 28 will take you to Munising and Marquette, where it joins with US 41.\n\nAccess from Wisconsin is most common through US 45 (central), US 141 (central-eastern), US 41 (far eastern) or US 2 (western). US 41 and US 2 are probably the most scenic choices.\n\nCyclists also enjoy touring through the U.P., utilizing the main roads above as well as many less-traveled county roads.

Snow tires and four-wheel drive would be helpful, as snowfall and drifting can get quite deep. Lake-effect snowfall is frequent along the shores of Lake Superior, and at times the flurries can be quite heavy. Watch the weather forecasts, and plan your trip accordingly. Driving at night during a snow storm can be dangerous, especially because of the distance between towns with gas stations that stay open late. Be prepared to pull over and wait out storms; keeping a warm blanket in the back seat for this purpose is a very good idea. On the bright side, motels are cheap, and some of them are busier than you would expect, thanks to the snowmobile crowd.\n\nThe pre-eminent scenic east-west route in the Upper Peninsula is US 2 along the northern shore of Lake Michigan.
