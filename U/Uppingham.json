The 747 also connectes Uppingham with Leicester every hour during the day from Monday to Saturday. A service also exists connecting Uppingham with Stamford.\nA new tourist bus service linking Uppingham and Oakham with various points around Rutand Water is due to commence in summer 2013.\n\nThere is free 2 hour on-street parking in the town centre, though on Fridays (market day), many drivers resort to using the Co-op supermarket's car park, or the pay and display car park - both on North Street East.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nUppingham is a small town, and easily traversable on foot.\n\nTaxi services are available throughout Rutland and beyond from Berridge Taxis - the main taxi firm in Rutland, and highly regarded.

Alternatively, one can relax in the very comfortable lounge area.  There are usually complimentary newspapers and bowls of nuts available in both areas.\n\nThe Crown\n\nThis is the only pub in town which offers real ale on tap.  They also host occasional real ale events and have earned awards for their efforts.  Accommodation is available.\n\nThe Vaults\n\nA recently modernised formerly-traditional pub overlooking the market square, with outdoor seating.  Meals are served, and sometimes - if you're lucky - complimentary cheese is left on the bar!  If there's one on, then this is a good place to watch major (or local) football or rugby matches.\n\nDon Paddy's\n\nAlso on the market square, this is the nearest thing Uppingham has to a trendy wine bar.  Don't expect anything too flash, but do expect a pleasant contemporary atmosphere with some outdoor seating at the front.  They also serve coffee and tea.\n\nThe Royal Oak\n\nThis is located on Queen Street - just off the High Street.  It is very much a locals' pub, but the people there are friendly enough.  It does offer a pool table, a small patio garden, and the cheapest drinks in town.\n\nThe Exeter Arms\n\nJust a short walk from the market square up High Street West to where it joins Stockerston Road, you'll find the Exeter Arms.\nThis is also primarily a locals' pub, and also boasts a pool table and patio garden.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nOvernight accommodation is available at the following:\n\nThe Falcon Hotel, High Street East\nThe Garden Hotel, High Street West\nLake Isle, High Street East\nThe Crown, High Street East\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Rutland (England)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Uppingham"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["52.59"],["-0.7222"]]}]
