It's to be expected that in very crowded systems during rush hour, people will be mashed against each other, but that is no excuse for someone to deliberately touch a stranger's private parts. Some rapid-transit systems, such as in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubai"]]},", have women-only areas. Others, like New York's, post and play announcements against molestation and advise victims not to remain silent. If you are being molested in a crowded metro car, speak up, and the rest of the passengers will generally support you.\n\nAn obvious danger is ",{"type":"'''","value":["falling"]}," onto the tracks. These are often electrified, so touching them can be fatal. Additionally, being struck by a train is also likely considering the high frequency of services. If you accidentally drop anything onto the tracks, inform the station staff and make no attempt to retrieve the item yourself, no matter how valuable it is.\n\nMany rapid transport systems have installed ",{"type":"'''","value":["automatic doors"]}," between the platform and the tracks, such as in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seoul"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},". This is done for general safety and also to prevent suicides. However, do not be surprised if some stations on a network lack such doors.\n\nGenerally speaking, if you get stuck in a train door owing to a crowded compartment, the train will not move and will open the door again.
