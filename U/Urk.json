While Urk endured, the conditions around it changed - the water body next to Urk turned from a peaceful sweetwater lake into a bay of the North Sea, ravaged by storms and tidal waves, while finally becoming shielded from the Sea by the dams built as parts of the grand water management works in the Netherlands. Finally, when the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Noordoostpolder"]]}," was reclaimed, Urk lost its status as an island and became a part of the large land mass, but did not lose its access to the IJsselmeer, which by that time was a sweetwater lake again.\n\nAll through that time, as well as today, Urkers have been relying on fishing as a source of both food and income. It was not easy life, which hardened the spirits of Urkers, and made them one of the most traditional and socially, as well as religiously, conservative communities of the Netherlands, which is a trait lasting until today. Urk has also developed a unique culture, with its own dialect and folk costumes, in which Urkers take pride.\n\nCompared to the rest of Flevoland, which is mostly deprived of any historic buildings, Urk is quite unique in being a genuinely old settlement rife with genuinely old architecture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Over land "]},"\nThe easiest way to get to Urk over land is by car (from the ",{"type":"'''","value":["A6"]}," going through Flevoland, exit into ",{"type":"'''","value":["N351"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["N352"]}," that terminate in Urk), as the public transportation options are limited and complicated, unless you are arriving directly from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Noordoostpolder"]]},".
