Due to outbreaks of typhus, pertussis and measles, by 1911, the Yámana had effectively disappeared; as of 2007, there was allegedly one pure-blooded native-speaking Yámana left.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Argentine government established a penal colony in Ushuaia intended for repeat offenders, serious criminals and some political prisoners, following similar examples by the French and British.  The prison population became forced colonists who spent most of their time chopping down the now-protected lenga trees which they used to build the town.  The prison shut down in 1947, but it and the railway to the settlement have now become the Museo Maritimo and the Tren del Fin del Mundo respectively.\n\nToday the town is growing fast as a result of increased tourism since the 2002 economic crash. The government has encouraged this growth by designating Tierra del Fuego a virtually tax-free zone to encourage people to settle; many of the inhabitants of today's Ushuaia come from Chaco, in the north of Argentina. The cost of living however, is relatively high as all goods have to be transported long distances, usually by container ship.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = 15"],["febhigh = 14"],["marhigh = 12"],["aprhigh = 10"],["mayhigh = 6"],["junhigh = 5"],["julhigh = 5"],["aughigh = 6"],["sephigh = 9"],["octhigh = 11"],["novhigh = 13"],["dechigh = 13"],["janlow = 6"],["feblow = 5"],["marlow = 4"],["aprlow = 2"],["maylow = 0"],["junlow = -1"],["jullow = -1"],["auglow = -1"],["seplow = 1"],["octlow = 2"],["novlow = 4"],["declow = 5"],["janprecip = 31"],["febprecip = 33"],["marprecip = 48"],["aprprecip = 50"],["mayprecip = 55"],["junprecip = 55"],["julprecip = 46"],["augprecip = 61"],["sepprecip = 40"],["octprecip = 35"],["novprecip = 35"],["decprecip = 41"],["jansnow ="],["febsnow ="],["marsnow ="],["aprsnow ="],["maysnow ="],["junsnow ="],["julsnow ="],["augsnow ="],["sepsnow ="],["octsnow ="],["novsnow ="],["decsnow ="],["jansun ="],["febsun ="],["marsun ="],["aprsun ="],["maysun ="],["junsun ="],["julsun ="],["augsun ="],["sepsun ="],["octsun ="],["novsun ="],["decsun ="],["janh2o ="],["febh2o ="],["marh2o ="],["aprh2o ="],["mayh2o ="],["junh2o ="],["julh2o ="],["augh2o ="],["seph2o ="],["octh2o ="],["novh2o ="],["dech2o ="],["description = The city experiences 146 days of precipitation and 206 cloudy days per year, with many cloudy and foggy days.
