The reserve has jungles, forests, plains, many streams, and most importantly, number of rare and endangered animals.\n\nDue to the verdant nature of the area, Uthai Thani is a province with relatively unspoiled natural tourist destinations. Visitors can see varying local lifestyles, such as the lives of raft residents on Sakae Krang River, a waterway that aided the birth of the province and which has been a lifeline for its people since ancient times. It is also where provincial trading has flourished.  Life revolving around the river eventually grew from a community into the major province that it is today.\n\nThe most striking indication of the bond between the people and the river since the old days is that in 1906, when King Rama V visited the northern provinces and stayed in Sakae Krang village, the monk Phra Khru Uthai Tham Nithet (Chan) built 2 twin rafts to receive the king. \nThis clearly showed the importance of the river and the lifestyle of the people living off it in that period.  \n\nIn addition, at the end of the Buddhist Lent, Buddhists from all directions congregate in the province for a major merit-making tradition called Tak Bat Thewo at the foot of Khao Sakae Krang at Wat Sangkat Rattana Khiri.  This festival has been held in Uthai Thani since ancient times.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Uthai Thani"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["15.380000"],["100.025000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Lower_Northern_Thailand"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]}]
