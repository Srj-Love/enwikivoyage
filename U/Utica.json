Frank Winfield Woolworth launched a \"five-cent store\" in Utica in 1878 which soon closed; the next year Woolworth's \"five and dime\" in Lancaster (Pennsylvania) proved successful. Like most American industrial cities, Utica has suffered from population loss and urban decay since the 1970s. However, the popular conception that has made Utica the butt of jokes in TV shows like The Office and The Simpsons is an exaggeration. Contemporary Utica, in addition to its historical points of interest, is a multi-cultural city with a restaurant selection and local arts scene that are robust for a city of its size.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Syracuse (New York)"],["Syracuse"]]}," Hancock International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SYR"]]},") and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Albany (New York)"],["Albany"]]}," International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ALB"]]},") offer scheduled flights to various cities.\n\nThe small regional airport in Utica is no longer in operation; the Oneida County airport has recently moved from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oriskany"]]}," and is now located in nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rome (New York)"],["Rome"]]},", with a 10,000-foot runway (at the former Griffiss Air Force Base).
