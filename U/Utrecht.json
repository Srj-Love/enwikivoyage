With 300,000 inhabitants it’s the fourth largest city in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netherlands"]]},". The history of the city goes back to 47 AD when the Roman emperor Claudius ordered his general Corbulo to build a defensive line along the river Rhine which was the northern most border of the empire. One of the strongholds (or Castella) along the river was built at a crossing in the river and was called Traiectum (which means crossingplace). In the local language this became Trecht, Uut-Trecht (lower-Trecht) and later Utrecht. On the place where once the castellum stood now stands the Domchurch built in the 13th century.\n\nUtrecht is known as a student city with a large population of single young people. This results in a booming nightlife with many places to have a quick meal, some drinks or a dance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Utrecht Centraal Station"]}," forms the hub of the Dutch rail network, and is easily accessible directly, or with one change of train, from almost every station in the Netherlands. For instance, there are frequent direct connections from Amsterdam and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Schiphol Airport"]]}," (even at night), both taking 30 minutes and for about €8 one-way. The high-speed train ICE to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cologne"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Frankfurt"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Basel"]]}," stops in Utrecht every two hours.\n\nThere are also connections with the daily CityNightLine trains to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Copenhagen"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warsaw"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prague"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zurich"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Munich"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Innsbruck"]]}," (seasonal). You can book tickets using the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nshispeed.nl NS Hispeed"]}," or ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/deutschebahn.com DB"]}," portals (they use different prices). There is no longer a Euronight train to Moscow; you will need to change in Berlin or Warsaw for this train.\n\nThe train station is located at the western edge of the old city. A 5 minute walk through the Hoog Catharijne shopping center (follow signs to “Centrum”) will take you from the station to the city or the bus station.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThe bus station is located next to the train station. International buses depart from the western side of the train station ('Jaarbeurszijde'), while the regional and city buses depart from separate stations on the east and west side of the train station. The reqional buses are much slower than the trains. For information about the city buses, check the U-OV website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.u-ov.info\/"]},", this is the company that provides public transport services in and around the city of Utrecht.

Electronic signs display the number of parking spaces available in any given lot as well as directions to the lot, and if the sign says ",{"type":"''","value":["Vol"]}," it means the lot is full. Expect to pay around € 2,60 per hour at any of the garages in the center. Parking on the curbside is also possible, but even more expensive. Expect to pay € 4 to € 5 an hour in advance at the meter. Parking fines are around € 70 and frequenty enforced, so make sure to get back to your car before the ticket expires. It’s best to avoid driving into central Utrecht. Instead, leave your car at the city perimeter and take a bus or tram into the center.\n\nThere are 2 ",{"type":"''","value":["transferiums"]}," (westraven & papendorp) where you can park your car for the day at a flat rate of around € 4,00, including transit to the city center by bus or tram for up to 5 passengers. One is on the southern side of the city, very close to the A12 highway exit number 17. The Nieuwegein-Utrecht tram line has a stop at this transferium and departs 8 times an hour daytime, 4 times an hour evening and weekends. Going back you can take a tram bound for either Nieuwegein or IJsselstijn, the last one departs at about 0.30 AM. The other transferium is near the football stadium, and connected to the city center by bus. Frequency of the bus service is comparable to that of the trams.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By tram"]},"\n\nUtrecht is connected to two neighboring towns by a high speed tram line.

It's a good idea to park your car there and to take the tram into town. The last two stop is at ",{"type":"''","value":["Utrecht Centraal Station"]},". You will need to cross the train station and the shopping center Hoog Catherijne to get to the inner city.\n\n€4.00 will allow you to park your car all day and to travel into the city with a maximum of five people.

You can buy these on the central bus station (lower level of Utrecht Centraal Station), at kiosks inside the central train station or at some book stores and grocery stores. The OV chipcard is valid for bus, train and tram and works like a debit card that you must first charge with an amount.  Buses do take cash though.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\n\nUsing a bike is the easiest way to travel in the city center if the weather is on your side. There are many bicycle shops located near the train station where you can rent bikes. Do make sure that you have good locks on your bike, as bike thefts are unfortunately quite common in the city centre. Also it's a good idea to make use of the free bike parking areas provided by the city council. They are usually guarded and are a safe place to park your bike.\nAlso recommended is to do a guided bike tour. There are several companies offering a city tour.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nA good alternative is taking the bus, which goes often and will take you nearly everywhere. Utrecht Centraal Station serves as the main bus hub for Utrecht as well as the main train hub for the Netherlands.  Most buses run from early morning (around 6AM) until just after midnight.  City center rides cost ~2,50 euros\n\nIn addition, there are several so-called nightlines ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.connexxion.nl\/reizen-met-connexxion\/14\/niteliner-utrecht\/340"]},". These cost 5 to 6 euros and can’t be paid for using strips or OV-chipcard.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By tram"]},"\n\nIn Utrecht there is a tram line from central station to southern suburbs Nieuwegein and IJsselstein. For tourists, only the first stops will be interesting, ",{"type":"''","value":["Westplein"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Graadt van Roggeweg"]},". These are located next to the Turkish neighbourhood and the main convention centre respectively.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nSeeing Utrecht by car is not recommended. The city planners have made it as difficult as possible to navigate the city center, to try and discourage cars there. Driving around can be frustrating as the center is fraught with bus-only lanes, one-way streets, traffic lights and terribly expensive parking spaces. If you want to come by car it is recommended to park at one of the P+R (Park and Ride) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.utrechtpenr.nl\/"]}," places, and take a cheap shuttle bus or tram service into town.
