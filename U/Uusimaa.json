All passenger airports in Finland except Lappeenranta have a flight to Helsinki (for many of them it is the only destination) and most longer train lines end in Helsinki. Direct buses connect Helsinki with all larger cities in Finland, and to get there from the smaller ones you would usually have to transfer just once. For other destinations in Uusimaa trains and buses usually stop on their way to Helsinki in cities along the route; so it is for instance possible to get off in Porvoo if you're coming from east or in Järvenpää if you're coming from north - otherwise you would most likely need to transfer in Helsinki.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAgain, Helsinki is the hub of the region and there are generally no form of public transportation bypassing the city. There are at least a couple of buses a day to every city and municipality in the region from Helsinki.
