As a World Heritage site, it is one of the best restored and maintained ruins in the Yucatan. Its architecture, some of the most dramatic of the Yucatan ruins, is characterized by low horizontal palaces set around courtyards, decorated with rich sculptural elements and details.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nUxmal was the greatest metropolitan and religious center in the Puuc hills in the late classical period. It thrived between the 7th and 10th century A.D. and its numerous architectural styles reflect a number of building phases.\n\nRecent studies have suggested that Uxmal was the capital of a regional state that developed in the Puuc region between 850 to 950 AD.

There is a small museum at the entrance, as well as a snack bar, gift shops, restrooms and various local vendors. Be sure to bring a hat, some sunscreen and good walking shoes. A camera is probably a good idea as well, as the buildings at Uxmal are very photogenic.

According to ancient legend, this pyramid was built by Itzamna in one night. It actually appears to have been built in five phases, and it was situated so that its western stairway faces the setting sun at summer solstice.  Note as of October 2009, tourists are no longer permitted to climb the House of the Magician.\n\nThe Nunnery, another large building on the site, was named by the Spaniards as it reminded them of a European nunnery. It was probably used as a school for training healers, astrologers, shamans and priests.\n\nThe Governor's Palace is an excellent example of stone mosaic work probably created by hundreds of masons and sculptors. It occupies five acres and contains many beautiful sculptures of the rain god Chaac, serpents and astrological symbols.\n\nOther buildings at Uxmal include the House of Turtles, decorated with turtle sculptures associated at that time with rain, the Dovecote, a building with many separate chambers, the House of the Old Woman, and more. Uxmal also has a large ballcourt, enclosing a playing field that is 110 feet long and 32 feet wide.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:2002.12.29_40_Uxmal_Yucatán_México.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Nunnery Quadrangle"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nUxmal offers a rich architecture of the Puuc Style, a city full of palaces, temples and a unique pyramid \"El Adivino\".
