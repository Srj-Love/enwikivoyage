Extreme caution should also be exercised in areas of the Ferghana Valley bordering Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.  There have been a number of security incidents in this region, as well as several exchanges of gunfire across the Uzbek\/Kyrgyz border. Some border areas are also mined. Travellers should therefore avoid these areas and cross only at authorized border crossing points.\n\nFor the most part, Uzbekistan is generally safe for visitors, perhaps the by-product of a police state.  There are many anecdotal (and a significant number of documented) reports of an increase in street crime, especially in the larger towns, particularly Tashkent.  This includes an increase in violent crime.  Information on crime is largely available only through word of mouth - both among locals and through the expat community - as the state-controlled press rarely, if ever, reports street crime.  As economic conditions in Uzbekistan continue to deteriorate, street crime is increasing.\n\nNormal precautions should be taken, as one would in virtually any country.  Especially in the cities (few travellers will spend much time overnight in the small villages), be careful after dark, avoid unlighted areas, and don't walk alone.  Even during the day, refrain from openly showing significant amounts of cash.  Men should keep wallets in a front pocket and women should keep purses in front of them with a strap around an arm.  Avoid wearing flashy or valuable jewellery which can easily be snatched.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Common scams"],["Scams"]]}," are not unheard of.  One of the most common (and one that is not limited to Uzbekistan) involves a stranger coming up to the victim and saying they have found cash lying on the street.  They will then try to enlist you in a complicated scheme that will result in you \"splitting\" the cash - of course only after you have put up some of your own.  The entire scenario is ludicrous, but apparently enough greedy foreigners fall for it that it continues.  If someone comes up to you with the \"found cash\" routine, tell them straight away that you are not interested (in whatever language you choose) and walk away.\n\nAlso beware of locals you don't know who offer to show you the \"night life.\"  This should be completely avoided, though some visitors seem to leave their common sense at home.\n\nWhile all of these precautions should be observed during travel virtually anywhere in the world, for some reason many tourists in Uzbekistan seem to lower their guard.  They should not.\n\nIt is also possible that you will be asked by police (Militsiya) for documents.  This doesn't happen often, but it can, and they have a legal right to do so.  By law, you should carry your passport and visa with you in Uzbekistan, though in practice, it is better to make a color scan of the first two pages of your passport and your Uzbek visa before you arrive.  Carry the colour copies with you when you're walking around, and keep the original documents in the hotel safe.  The scanned documents will almost always suffice. If not, make it clear to the Militsiya officer that he will have to come to your hotel to see the originals.  Unless they have something out of the norm in mind (such as a bribe) they will almost always give you a big smile and tell you to go along.  Always be polite with the Militsiya, but also be firm.  While almost all of them take bribes, they take them from locals.  For the most part, they understand that going too far with a foreigner will only cause them problems, especially if the foreigner is neither being abusive nor quaking with fear. \n\nOne note about locals offering to show you around:  It is common for younger Uzbeks (usually male) who speak English to try and \"meet\" foreigners at local hotels and offer to serve as interpretors and guides.  This is done in daylight and in the open, often in or near some of the smaller but better hotels.  This can be rewarding for both the local and the visitor.  The local is usually trying to improve their English or French (occasionally other languages, but usually English) and to make a few dollars\/euros.  If you are approached by a clean-cut person offering such services, and you are interested, question them about their background, what they are proposing to do for you and how much they want to charge you (anywhere between $10-$25 a day is realistic depending on their services and how long they spend with you).  Most of the legitimate offers will be from young people who have studied in the West on exchange programs and\/or studied at the University of World Diplomacy and\/or Languages in Tashkent.  If everything seems to fit, their language skills are good and they seem eager and polite, but not pushy, you may want to consider this.  They should offer to show you museums, historical sites, cafés, bazaars, cultural advice, generally how to get around, etc.  They should ask you what you want to see and\/or do.  Often this works out well.  However, for your and their protection, do not attempt to engage in political discussions of any type. \n\nAgain, if they are proposing \"night life\" (or related) services, do NOT take up their offers.\n\nDue to sliding relationships between the USA and Uzbekistan over the past years the US State Department has strongly discouraged travel to Uzbekistan by American citizens.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nUzbekistan has not implemented a no-smoking policy in bars and restaurants, unlike many Western countries.  Consequently, enclosed spaces can be very unpleasant for non-smokers, especially in the cold weather.\n\nFruits and vegetables should be peeled before consumption.\nAvoid drinking Uzbek (locally produced) vodka.
