It is located right on both the Belgian and German border, with the much larger German city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aachen"]]}," at just a stone's throw away. A popular holiday destination for Dutch domestic tourists, the town is surrounded by the rolling hills this region is famous for and is known for its beautiful landscapes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe borders of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands meet here in Vaals, on the Drielandenpunt. The official place of the Drielandenpunt is just a few steps aways from the highest point of the Netherlands, the Vaalserberg. Vaals is a friendly town for tourists, with regular activities and a beautiful natural area surrounding it. The Dutch call it \"a piece of abroad in the Netherlands\".\n\nThe municipality Vaals comprises this town itself as well as a few other villages and hamlets. The main population centres are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Vijlen"]]}," and its hamlets, the highest located village in the country and popular with hikers and bikers."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lemiers"]]},", a small village with a nice, old church."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Holset"]]},", a tiny village with some good options to eat and a medieval church."]},"\nA large number of the inhabitants, up to 26%, are Germans. Nowadays, the town's main activity is tourism. Many Dutch, German and Belgian tourists visit this friendly town each year, with the Drielandenpunt as it's main attraction but mostly of course for the beautiful scenery and picturesque hamlets around town.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe oldest archaeological traces of human settlements in Vaals were found in the nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vijlen"]]},"er forest, and date from the time of Linear Potter culture, about 5000BC. The origin of the town's name is Roman, with its ancient names Vals and Vallis meaning \"in the Valley\".\nVaals is first mentioned in documents in 1041. In that time, Emperor Henry III donated land to the St. Adalbert Abbey and to distinguish between the city of Aachen and this land, it is referred to as \"in the valley\"\/in Vallis. In those days, the centre of the municipality was ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Holset"]]},", also home to a high court of justice.\n\nGiven the location of the municipality, along the main (and originally Roman) road between Aachen and Maastricht, Vaals observed many armies passing by. During the war against the Spanish occupation, in 1568, the armed forces of William of Orange passed through Vaals and looted St. Pauls Church.\n\nIn 1661 Vaals became part of the Republic of the United Netherlands. Many wealthy citizens moved to Vaals and turned it into a flourishing industrial hub. One prominent industrial family were the Von Clermonts, who moved from Aachen to Vaals in 1761 and established a large linen factory, with clientèle in Prussia, Belgium, Austria, Poland and even Russia. In 1717, Tsar Peter the Great visited the Von Clermonts. In 1803, Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France, and his wife Josephine de Beauharnais visited Vaals and stayed in Bloemendal Castle, one of the outhouses of the Von Clermont family.\n\nDuring the Conference of Vienna, Aachen was assigned to Prussia and Vaals to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Upon the Belgian declaration of independence in 1830, Vaals was Belgian claimed territory until it was reassigned to the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1839. As a result, the four national boundaries of Prussia, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Neutral Territory of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moresnet"]]},", met near Vaals until Moresnet was absorbed into Belgium in 1919 and the current 3 countries point remained.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["After 1840"]},"\nDue to increased competition and the political closure of the German and Belgian regio to Vaals, industrial activity went down after 1840. Vaals turned from a wealthy industrial town into a leisure and holiday destination for the citizens of Aachen. Its casino's in this time made it a Monte Carlo like destination for the well-to-do of the surrounding regions. Germans referred to the town as the \"Vaalser Paradies\". To stimulate industry and tourism, a tram was installed in 1922 from Aachen, via Vaals to Wijlre, which was expanded to Maastricht in 1924. This prestigious and costly project was not very successful, as the tram ran no more than 13 years.\n\nBefore and during World War II the borders were closed and Vaals grew isolated due to its remote location in the Netherlands. After the war, commerce rose. Germans visited Vaals on a daily basis, as they still do today. Many inhabitants of Vaals found jobs in Aachen and smuggle routes across the border prospered. The smugglers of Vaals were called \"The Owls of Vaals\", referring to their nightly endeavours. Nowadays, the borders are of course open and Vaals is well embedded in the Aachen local transport system.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=VVV Limburg tourist information store Vaals"],["url=http:\/\/www.vvvzuidlimburg.nl"],["email="],["address=Maastrichterlaan 73a"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +31 900-5559798 (€1 per conversation)"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The tourist information office is a well equipped place with maps, tours and information on all major sights.
