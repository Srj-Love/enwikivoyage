[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Vacation rentals"]}," are houses or apartments in tourist destinations that are generally leased to leisure travelers. The residence may have been bought specifically for this purpose, or the regular occupants may vacate it during some parts of the year. The guests will have full use of the residence, typically with utilities included but without servicing or meals. This approach can be cheaper than booking a hotel room or in some cases, several hotel rooms for the same length of time, especially if traveling with a family or other sizable group of people. Vacation rentals are often stocked with a variety of amenities to make your stay more enjoyable, including a private hot tub or swimming pool (without the noisy neighbors), a full-size kitchen (so you donâ€™t have to dine out for every meal), laundry facilities (so you can pack light), etc. Contacting the owners directly is the ideal way to make arrangements as they can answer any questions you may have about the property. Vacation rental agencies that professionally manage locations are also a popular option as you can be assured that your vacation will be successful since the facility will be clean and available.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Advantages"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Families traveling with children get privacy for parents, lower accommodation cost, lower meal cost, added together means stays can now be longer.
