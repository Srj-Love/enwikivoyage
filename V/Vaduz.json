Still, it's home to the Prince's castle and his museums, and thus the main point of interest for visitors to this small country which is a shame because it is a rather disappointing hodge-podge of unattractive modern buildings, cranes and farmland.

Trains only run a few times a day, which makes buses generally more convenient.  \n\nBuses run every 15 minutes from the train station at Buchs (the main Swiss town on the Liechtenstein border) to Schaan and Vaduz. Tickets can be purchased on the bus for 3.40 CHF and it only takes about 10 minutes to Schaan and another 5 to Vaduz.\n\nIf you're coming by rail from Switzerland, it may be quicker and cheaper to take the train as far as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sargans"]]}," (rather than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buchs"]]},"), from where it's possible to catch a bus (see below) straight to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vaduz"]]},".

Consider getting a whole network day pass (12 CHF) or week pass (24 CHF) if you are making many journeys on Liechtenstein Buses, though two single fares (e.g. from Sargens or Buchs to Vaduz and Vaduz onward to Feldkirch) cost less than a day pass.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Feldkirch"]]}," railway station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austria"]]},", look for the distinctive off-yellow Liechtenstein Buses.

The old covered bridge which spans the Rhine river provides an interesting way to cross the border between Liechtenstein and Switzerland. The unpainted, weathered wooden bridge is rustic in appearance.  It accommodates foot or bicycle traffic only, cars are prevented from approaching.  Drives may find it tricky to pull-off.  Cars on this road are headed to the Swiss Autobahn, a few hundred meters across the river directly west of the bridge. Please use care, these motorists may not tolerate the casual traveller on a busy road.  There is no means to access the bridge from the west by car.  The road that would appear to lead to the western end of the bridge is the aforementioned Swiss Autobahn.  \n\nFrom the centre of Vaduz follow Zollstrasse (towards the football stadium) until you reach the river.

People who enjoy collecting passport stamps are able to get an official Liechtenstein Tourist Office stamp at the Tourist Information office. The cost was 2 Swiss Franc (CHF) or €3 in September 2009. This is especially unique as there are no border crossings at either of Liechtensteins frontiers. Postal Stamps and postcards can be bought at the post office opposite the tourist office as well as most other shops.\n\nThere is also a small retail village between Vaduz and Balzers.
