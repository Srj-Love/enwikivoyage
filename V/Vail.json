It's exactly 100 miles from Denver, and about 130 miles from Denver International Airport.\n\nDuring peak times, I-70 can get very congested and it is not unheard of for a trip from Vail to Denver to take 3 hours or more. Peak times are weekend afternoons (2PM-6PM) both in the summer and winter.  Plan accordingly and either leave in the morning, or leave Vail after 5PM in the winter. If you do leave after dusk, however, be warned that road conditions can get icy. If you are from a major metropolitan area, the drive may also seem very dark to you with virtually no highway lighting and no reflectors on the roadway. Due to the darkness, high beam laws are often ignored. You can get a snapshot of travel conditions on the Colorado Highway Patrol web site ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/cotrip.org"]},".\n\nIf you are not experienced with winter driving conditions, you may want to think twice about travelling to Vail by rental car.  Although most of the time you'll find the highway dry and perfectly fine, when it snows the road can get nasty. The ride from Denver takes you from 5,280' to the Eisenhower pass\/tunnel at over 11,000'. After a steep drop to Silverthorne at 8,750' I-70 winds through Officer's Gulch which is notorious for black ice conditions, high winds and white out conditions when the weather is severe. I-70 then climbs over Vail Pass at 10,650' before the drop to the Vail Valley floor at 8,120'. If you are uncomfortable driving in the severe conditions that may occur on this drive, it is recommended that you spend a little extra money and employ one of the private charter services available in the Vail Valley. Note that although some Denver based companies also offered chartered service to Vail, their drivers often have limited experience in severe weather. Many Denver charter companies also use all season tires in the winter. If you do a little research, you should be able to find a reputable Vail based company that uses studded snow tires during the winter.\n\nScheduled and chartered services are available from Denver International Airport and Eagle County Regional Airport.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Powder Day Vail Colorado USA.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Champagne Powder Day on Vail Mountain"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nFly into ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vail\/Eagle County"]}," Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["EGE"]]},") or ",{"type":"'''","value":["Denver International"]}," Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["DEN"]]},").  Note: Vail\/Eagle County Airport is still about 35 miles from Vail, a shared ride in a Van from there to Vail will cost you about $70 per person. If you are traveling with your family or in a group, there are a number of private charter services that are also available. These are often more convenient than a shared ride service since they transport you door to door. Although you might think about renting a car, parking is expensive in Vail and most everything is in walking distance or a short ride away on the town's extensive free bus system. If you fly into Denver, you might think about renting a car, but you should be warned that the 100+ mile trip from Denver takes you over 2 mountain passes at elevations of 11,000 and 10,600 feet. An option to get from Denver Airport to Vail is to take a private chartered service that is familiar with the drive and road conditions.\n\nAnother Option from Eagle Airport is to use the county bus system (ECO). This is difficult to find: Exit the airport out the front door, make a right and walk about 100 feet to the bus stop. The bus takes about 80 minutes. The bus runs from Eagle airport through most of the towns and goes to the Vail Transportation Center. The cost in 2011 was $4 each way.\n\nMost private \"transport companies\" quote prices of $120 to $180 each way for a trip into Vail.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nSeveral carriers offer limo, van, or bus service to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aspen"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]},", and other cities in Colorado ($300 one-way), or the Eagle Vail airport ($100 one-way).

The town is set up so you can walk between most places and the slopes.

It will cost about $25 (2010) per day.  Best advice arrive early (before 9AM) on busy days and you won't have problems.  There are two parking garages, one in Vail and one in Lionshead.  The Lionshead garage is the shortest walk to the slopes.\n\nIf the garages do fill up, you may to park on the road.  The problem being that they don't let you park on the road until BOTH garages are filled.  So say you drop your friends off at Golden Peak (so they can put their kids in child care) then go back to the Vail parking lot, its full, so you then have to go park in Lionshead and take a bus back to catch your friends.\n\nFor those doing child care there is also a ($25\/day) valet parking at Golden Peak, cheaper to park at the main Vail garage and walk (5 mins).  Most Hotels in Vail, (see: upscale) will provide you with a free shuttle, just ask before you arrive.\n\nMost major car-rental firms are located in Denver and Vail airports.\n\nThere a many free buses going throughout the Vail valley.
