The walled town itself, like so many others, is full of quaint streets and interesting nooks. For reasons which are unclear Biot seems to have cats the way most towns have mice, they are everywhere and make for nice pictures.\n\nValbonne is a curiosity in that the old town is laid out on a rectangular grid around the main square. It was founded as part of an abbey and the church, at the bottom of the town, is the original abbey church.\n\nSophia Antipolis is not really anything special to visit although those familiar with Silicon Valley may find its pretensions to be the French equivalent rather amusing. However it is undoubtedly a far prettier place to work than the average anonymous Santa Clara office block.
