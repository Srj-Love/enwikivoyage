Quickest is to fly to Valdez Airport. There are three flights a day, offered by ERA Aviation. The flight takes 40 minutes and costs around $400 return. If it's clear, you'll get great views of the Chugach mountains. Or in a full day you could drive the Richardson Highway. Or, you could drive or go by rail to Whittier and try and get a boat across Prince William Sound. The boat trip would take at least four hours. However, most boats from Whittier only offer day trips - glacier sight seeing and fishing - there isn't a scheduled ferry between Whittier and Valdez\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nNo public transport. Car and bike rental are available. The new airport is a couple of miles out of town, so if arriving by air, you'll need to get a taxi into town to avoid a tedious trudge. Once in town, walking is a good way to get around, as the town itself is small.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Valdez Marine Terminal.jpg"],["thumb"],["Valdez Marine Terminal"]]}," \n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Harbor"]},{"type":"*","value":["Duck Flats"]},{"type":"*","value":["Mineral Creek"]},{"type":"*","value":["Pipeline Terminal"]},{"type":"*","value":["Valdez Museum"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Whitewater Rafting on the Lowe River through Keystone Canyon"]},{"type":"*","value":["Sea Kayak Prince William Sound.
