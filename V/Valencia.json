The city center and the most visited neighborhoods are not particularly close to the beach. The construction of the city esplanade in the eighties, along with the marina, and the recovery of the tram to the maritime neighborhoods, have had a big influence to ease this stance.\n\nValencia was founded by the Romans and was held by the Moors from the 8th to the 13th century (with a short interruption by El Cid). In 1609, the Moors who had converted to Catholicism were expelled from the city.

This is the reason why the night of the cremà (in which the Fallas monuments burn down) is always on March 19, the Festivity of San José.\nIn the 18th century, Fallas used to be piles of combustible materials that were called \"Fallas\" and were burnt the night before the day of San José.\nThese Fallas evolved and acquired a more critical and ironic sense when showing in the monuments reprehensible social scenes.\nAround 1870, the Fallas celebration ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fallasparty.com"]}," was forbidden, as well as Carnival. In 1885 this pressure created a movement that defended typical traditions by awarding in the magazine \"LaTraca\" the prizes to the best ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lasfallas.net  Fallas Monuments"]},". This competition, which began to be popular among different neighbourhoods, brought the creation of the artistic Falla, where critique was still an important element together with aesthetics.\nIn 1901 the Ayuntamiento de Valencia awarded local prizes to the best Fallas. This was the beginning of the union between the people and the political power. This relationship has greatly developed this popular festivity in its structure, organisation and size.\nIn 1929 the first poster contest for the promotion of the Festivities and in 1932 the Fallero weekend was established. It what then, when Fallas became the Mayor Festivity of the Region of Valencia. Today, more than seven hundred big and small Fallas are burned in the city of Valencia.\n\nValencia has a fantastic festival each March called ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fallasfromvalencia.com\/ Fallas"]}]},", in which local areas build big papier-mâché models. They are mostly of a satirical nature and can be as tall as a few stories. Fallas are constructed of smaller figures called ",{"type":"''","value":["ninots"]},", Valencian for \"dolls\". The fallas take a whole year of planning and construction to complete. Each neighborhood has a falla, but 14 fall into the Sección Especial category and these are the most important, expensive, and impressive. Each falla has an adult falla (mayor) and a kid's falla (infantil). It is best to arrive by 16 March, as all of the fallas are required to be finished or they face disqualification.\n\nAnother feature of Fallas is the fireworks. It's like the city's a war zone for a week! They wake you up early in the morning and go on through the day. Every day, there are three fireworks events, la despertà, la mascletà, and el castillo. La despertà occurs every morning at 8AM in order to wake you up. At 2PM in the main square of the city, the Plaza del Ayuntamiento, there's a thing they call ",{"type":"''","value":["Mascletá"]},". This is 120 kilos of gunpowder translated into a lot of noise. It has to be experienced to be understood. This is very popular and you should arrive an hour in advance at least. Every night between midnight and 1AM, there is a castillo, a fireworks display. The last night it's called la nit de foc, ",{"type":"''","value":["the night of fire"]},", and this is the most impressive. This is also very crowded and you need to arrive early to be able to see it. Along with these displays, people set off fireworks all day, making it very difficult to catch any sleep.\n\nThe days of 17th and 18 March is La Ofrenda. The falleras from each falla take flowers to the Plaza of the Virgin. These flowers are used to construct the virgin. The processions are grand and very beautiful and worth catching. They follow two main paths: one down calle San Vicente and the other down Calle de Colon.\n\nAt the end of a week displaying the 'fallas' they are burnt. This is called la cremà. The fallas infantiles are burned at 10PM and the fallas mayores are burned anywhere from midnight to 1AM. The one at the town halls is burned last at 1AM. The most impressive to see are the fallas in Sección Especial, because these are the largest and most dramatic when they burn.
