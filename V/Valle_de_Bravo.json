A lot of the clothing and shoes being sold are used items that have been brought back from trips to the U.S. to sell. There are various booths that sell C.D.s and DVDs, at very low prices but decent quality. There are many booths that sell fresh foods, such as fruits and vegetables, fresh meat, and tortillas. This is also a great place to grab a bite to eat. There are a lot of different booths where you can sit down and eat, but plan on getting there early to get a table. And don't worry about getting wet because all the booths are covered with tents. It is really a great place to go in Valle, you  can find almost anything. From the guy who does a very good job cleaning and fixing jewelry for a really low price to the best \"carnitas\" you will ever have. The people in Valle are very nice! Downtown Valle is very, very beautiful.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Do√±a Petra"],["url="],["email="],["address=City square (Zocalo)"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=There is an old lady who has a little portable kitchen that makes the most delicious pambasos ever.

Also there are ice cream carts in the town square. In my opinion the best kind to try is MAMEY. (a type of fruit, that tastes like a mix of cantalope and almonds.) The actual fruit is about the size of a mango, but is dark brown in color when ripe. ~~TIP~~ If you buy a \"mamey\" that is  not quite ripe, wrap it newspaper and let it sit a day or two. (Also, U.S customs will not allow this fruit to be brought into the united states even if you remove the pit).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThere are plenty of nightclubs in Valle de Bravo that are geared towards tourists and weekend locals.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["19.1833"],["-100.1333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Mexico State"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Valle de Bravo"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Valle de Bravo"]]}]
