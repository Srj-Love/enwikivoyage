Hillcrest is the main village, boasting many restaurants and bars that serve everything from fish and chips to steak and veg, lobster and prawns - all fresh South African produce grown, raised, or caught locally. This area is called the Bible Belt of South Africa, home to all kinds of churches and denominations with congregations ranging from 30 to 5000, making traffic something of a challenge on a Sunday morning.\n\nSugar cane used to be the main source of income in the area but that has been given to developers and around 5000 families have moved into the Hillcrest area over the past 5 years. As Hillcrest is having a population explosion the Valley of a 1000 hills are seeing more people move out and property prices are rising.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kranzkloof Nature Reserve"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Isithumba"]]}," cultural village"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Phe Zulu African craft village"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Midlands meander"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThis area is poor and seeing the highest rate of deaths due to HIV Aids.
