Three separate buildings in Vandalia served as the Capitol: the first burned, the second was torn down, and the third remains as a historic site, maintained both as a part of Illinois history, and more importantly as a part of the life of Abraham Lincoln.

This was the first federally-funded road in the new country. While funding shortfalls stopped the road in Vandalia in 1839, the National Road served as the gateway to the west for thousands of settlers, bringing them as far as central Illinois. When the \"modern\" US highway system was developed in 1925, the National Road became a part of US 40.\n\nToday, you may tour the last Vandalia State Capitol, sit in the chamber where Lincoln sat, visit the National Road Interpretive Center, and see Lincoln-era artifacts and antiques at the county museum.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nVandalia is on Interstate 70, between St. Louis and Indianapolis.
