Still not much more than three streets and a bus station, the main attractions are the river, laid back countryside, and cave-filled rock formations. \n\nAnyone who has travelled in Southeast Asia will have heard about tubing, an activity that dominates this town and its visitors. Originally opened up by hedonistic backpackers, the atmosphere of the town itself is one of lethargy by day and debauchery by night. Tourists sprawl out in the pillow-filled restaurants, termed \"TV Bars\", watching re-runs of US sitcoms, ",{"type":"''","value":["Friends"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Family Guy"]}," episodes, until the sun goes down, and then party heavily until the early hours. \n\nA couple of kilometres upstream, the pulsating music, drinking games and drug-fuelled debauchery of the increasingly lively riverside \"tubing\" bars starts at lunchtime.\n\nVang Vieng may have established itself as the exception to the rule that Laos doesn't have nightlife. It does have potential as a base for adventure tourism which attracts a few more sedate foreign sightseers. However, it can be considered a noisy \"back-packer hell\" and so those wishing to avoid noisy, selfish teenagers away from their parents for the first time and instead seek something Laotian would do as well to either use Vang Vieng only as a base to explore the surrounding countryside or avoid it all together.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nVang Vieng is on Hwy 13 between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vientiane"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Luang Prabang"]]},".

Minivans leave Vientiane all day and cost between 35,000-50,000 kip. The express bus to Vientiane costs 60,000 kip. Slower local buses to Vientiane without air conditioning run in the early morning (05:30-10:00) and cost about 40,000 kip for a 5 hour journey. You can board them either at the northern bus station or the bus stop south of the airstrip.\n\nFrom Luang Prabang, VIP buses cost 150,000 kip and minivans cost 120,000 kip.

The airstrip is directly behind the main street, so in either case there is no need to take a tuk-tuk or cyclo if you plan to stay in the main area of town. The island and bungalows along the river are about a 10 min walk away. Buses to and from the north Laos leave from the new bus terminal 2 km north of town.

Motorbike rentals are also widely available. It's quite easy to rent a motorbike from a local business for only 40,000-60,000 kip. Always check the details of the contract. At some places you will have to sign a contract which makes you completely responsible if something breaks or fails to function, even if it's normal wear and tear. Also you are not allowed to go out of Vang Vieng District, so don't count on renting a bike here to go on a longer tour of the district.\n\nSeveral ",{"type":"'''","value":["tuk-tuks"]}," are also scattered around town. 10,000 kip per person will be plenty to get to anywhere within Vang Vieng. It's also the price you'll pay to get to the tubing bars irrespective of how many other people are on board. It's better to sort out exact change with fellow passengers as tuk-tuk drivers are notorious for giving incorrect change.\n\nTo rent a tuk-tuk for the whole day costs about 130,000-150,000 kip.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Vang vieng.jpeg"],["thumb"],["240px"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Padeng Cave and Ring Cave"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Cross a footbridge over the river, follow the signs and white flags (garbage bags) on sticks through the field"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=10,000 kip for the hill, 15,000 kip for the cave, 30,000 kip to go to the cave lagoon"],["content=Across the river a 1.5 km path marked by white flags cuts through the fields towards the limestone mountains.

Tubes get stacked up at each bar so keep an eye on how many are left, especially at the first few bars where lots of people arrive without their own tube. If you're not used to drinking liquor, stick with beer and for reasons of safety and common sense consider avoiding alcohol completely if entering the water. The amount of alcohol in buckets can be seriously high and can kick in suddenly; you won't be the first one to be too drunk to make your way back on the river. As of 2014, only 4 bars remain open, and all are fairly close to the beginning of the tubing.

If you want to jump into the river, be very careful about where you do so - the Nam Song isn't very deep except where the bar staff have cleared rocks from the river bed. Don't even think of pushing others in: at least one person has died that way.\n\nNeedless to say, if the alcohol or drugs you've consumed may impair your ability to swim or climb out, ",{"type":"'''","value":["don't enter the water"]},", even on a rubber tube. Remember whisky buckets can be deceptively strong and their effects can kick in very quickly.\n\nThe river current is strong in many places - even the stone-cold sober should avoid sapping their strength by swimming against it. It should be easy enough to swim across to shallower water instead.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Drugs "]},"\nHistorically accepted drugs, such as marijuana, mushrooms and opium are freely available in many bars and restaurants around town. The majority of bars have \"magic menus\" offering most of these drugs. Consuming them on the premises is fairly safe, although drugs are illegal in Laos and nothing is totally safe.   \n\nYaa-​baa (ยาบ้า), the Thai\/Lao name for a narcotic made of methamphetamine and caffeine, is available in both pill and smokeable forms. It was formerly legal in Thailand as a way for long-haul truckers to stay awake. Yaa-baa is highly addictive. Manufactured locally, the drug can be cut with any number of substances.  \n\nAside from the drugs already mentioned it is inadvisable to attempt to purchase any other substances not freely available on the magic menus around town. The dangers of most drugs should be well-known to travellers, and additionally there is also a police presence. Plain-clothed policemen frequently take unsuspecting tourists to the local police station for smoking a joint. The usual outcome of this involves having your passport seized until you cough up a hefty \"fine\", typically between 3-5 million kip. Once the fine is paid, however, the matter is generally taken no further and the passport returned. But the punishment will depend on the officer you are dealing with. Several local policemen are best friends and drinking buddies with restaurateurs who sell opium, mushrooms, cannabis and yaa-baa. Customers are not harassed at these establishments. The police wait until they leave. Some of these same cops own guesthouses near the island. Never surrender your passport if you can help it, and often the best way out of the situation is simply to pay up.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Medical Issues "]},"\nA minor annoyance around Vang Vieng (referred to by locals and long-time residents as the \"Vang Vieng plague\") is conjunctivitis, or pink eye.  This is a viral, and sometimes bacterial, infection which can be caught from the river or other tubers. The onset of conjunctivitis is often felt as an unnatural tiredness, and inability to properly fully open your eyes. If you sense this, or have been sharing buckets with people with conjunctivitis or wearing sunglasses at night, the best thing to do is shell out for eye drops as soon as possible to prevent the onset. If this should happen late at night, be aware that eye drops alone should cost a maximum of 20,000 kip. Some of the late night pharmacies attempt to extort tourists, charging up to 5x the normal price for eye drops.\n\nAs well as eye drops, general antibiotics are available from any pharmacy. In some cases eye drops will cause an intense stinging sensation, this can be soothed with an eye bath formula also available at pharmacies. Of course the sensible solution would be to rest your eyes and ease the drinking, but Vang Vieng's non-stop party atmosphere makes this a hard option for most. Should your conjunctivitis last longer than a week you should probably seek proper medical advice, and stop drinking all that Tiger Whisky to give your body time to heal.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Taxiboat "]},"\nWhen tubing home late and its getting cold and dark, there are taxi boats who offer to take you home for a price of around 10,000 kip each. These boats will just take you to some place and stop there, refusing to continue. They tie up the boat, take away the engine and go away, waiting for you to get out and grab a waiting tuk tuk for a high price back home, because they know that you are freezing and want to take back your tube. If you don't want to pay the tuk-tuk, the only way to get home is to walk.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nInternet speed and reliability is variable but not bad by Laos standards.
