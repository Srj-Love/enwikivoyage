Depending on how close to the town of Varadero your hotel is located, many opportunities to explore either on foot or with a vehicle are present.

Look for the blue sign-posts to indicate stops, routing, and schedules. 5cuc gets you a day pass that you can use as much as you want goes along the whole peninsula.

They are more prevalent in town, but any hotel concierge or front desk can arrange one upon request.

The basement offers Varadero´s most luxurious and expensive restaurant, \"Las Américas\". On the first floor there are 5 finely decorated and equipped guest rooms, plus a presidential suite.

In Varadero, Cayo Largo del Sur, Jardines del Rey (Coco and Guillermo Keys), Santa Lucía Beach, Covarrubias Beach, and Holguín province, you can also pay in euros.\nCredit Cards (except those issued by US banks or their branches in other countries) can be used in most Varadaro shops but it is more useful to take cash (CUCs) to the markets.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Currency Exchange"]},"\n\nIn Cuba there are two different currencies: Cuban Convertible Pesos (CUC) and Cuban Pesos (CUP). (1 CUC=24 CUP).\n\nYou may exchange Euros, Canadian dollars, Pounds, Swiss francs, and others for Cuban Convertible Pesos. The exchange rates for those currencies are set in accord with the exchange rates on the international market. You can acquire 'pesos convertibles' at the airport, banks and at the Money Exchange Offices, called \"CADECA\" (you can find these offices everywhere in the country). You can obtain Cuban Pesos also in the CADECAs or at any local bank or at the front desk of your resort.\n\nMake sure you count your change at CADECA before leaving the booth. The exchange booth at the Varadero Airport is known to short-change tourists by trimming it to the nearest 10CUC, which is never a practise throughout the country as they're supposed to give change to the nearest 5 centavos (0.05 CUC).  \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Shopping"]},"\n\nBeach Vendors are abundant on the beaches bracketing the resorts. Their \"carts\" are built up from a bicycle with many shelves and hooks to display their wares while easily rolling along the beach. Haggling is not as common in Cuba as it is in the Dominican but it can be done.\n\nThe usual items that people shop for in Cuba are rum, cigars, coffee and jewelry.\n\nRum is best purchased at the Casa de Ron, this shop has the best selection. Though other small grocery stores and hotel gift shops stock the favorites.\n\nAcross the street from the Casa de Ron is the cigar shop. Again, the selection is enormous and the prices are better than in some of the hotel gift shops.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nMany packages are \"all-inclusive\" at major resorts, especially those further up the peninsula. These cater primarily to North American tourists, who make up the bulk of visitors. Some of them do offer room\/hotel packages (EP, or European Plan), but they are becoming harder to find. Most hotels past the golf course are all-inclusive by circumstance, as there are few nearby restaurants. There is a very good restaurant at the Marina, and several at the International Shopping Centre. The clubhouse at the Varadero Golf Course (this was the old Dupont Mansion) has an extensive menu and a lovely setting overlooking the ocean on one side, the golf course on the other.\n\nIn the town of Varadero, there is everything from open-air marketplace-type food stalls to the local version of fast food. In town you can find: Pollo Loco (pronounced Po-Yo Lo-Ko, or crazy chickens), hamburguesas con queso (cheeseburgers), sandwiches (surprisingly, pressed Cuban sandwiches are hard to find), and the odd pizza joint. There are also a few restaurants serving sit-down dinners and lunches. Chicken, pork and fish are the most frequent items, but beef is not hard to find. Menus are usually posted outside.\n\nVisitors staying at any of the hotels in town have many choices. Many of these hotels are older and nowhere near as fancy as the beach resorts, and they cater to a different clientele.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThe Mojito is Cuba's signature drink. Made with freshly crushed mint, lime juice and white rum it is a unique delicious flavour. Second to the Mojito is the Cuba Libre, a combination of rum, cola and lime juice.\n\nCristal beer can be had for a dollar a can. It is a good tasting light pilsner. Mayabe is another good beer, not as light at Cristal and not as heavy as the much stronger Bucanero or Bucanero Fuerte. Most all inclusive resorts stock both Cristal and Bucanero.\n\nCaney is made in the former Bacardi factory on the east end of the island. It is Cuba's premium brand of rum. It's available in Carta Blanca (white), or traditionally darker varieties of differing aging quality. Rum is called \"Ron\" in Cuba and \"Ron Mulatta\" is a cheaper brand often supplied to inclusive hotels (it tastes just as good). If you don't drink Rum you might want to stop into the duty free store on the way down and bring your favorite drink. Low quality Russian Vodka can be obtained in Havana, but high quality spirits are hard to find and expensive as it caters to Cuba’s tourists.\n\nWine made in Cuba is very sweet and not all that far from grape juice. It has its charms but true wine lovers may want to bring a bottle from home or the duty free shop.\n\nCubans also drink plenty of coffee, and they like to brew it strong. Order café espresso for a straight shot, or café con leche if you'd like it mixed with warm milk. Ask for café americano if you want a milder brew.\n\nYou can drink the water in Cuba but it is recommended that you purchase bottled water, which is available throughout the island in hotels and resorts. Another option is to buy a big bottle of water on your first days and keep refilling it at the resort drink fountains where water, cola and other soft drinks are dispensed.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Paladar de la 31"],["url="],["email="],["address=Calle 31"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Very extense menu with Cuban specialities, incredibly tasty pastas, sushi, salads, stews and a lot of dishes that you won't normally find in Varadero.

It is, however, arguably the safest country in the Caribbean for travelers, including single females. Use your common sense and you'll be fine.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Credit card scam at Varadero Airport"]}," — This scam involves storekeepers in small shops taking out a purchase as a cash advance on your credit card. When the victim tries to purchase, the shopkeeper says 'one moment' and goes to an accomplice working at the CADECA cash exchange counter to give the amount of the cash advance and the card number. The CADECA teller then processes the cash advance, and the storekeeper asks the victim to return to show passport and sign. The receipt appears like a sale as it is written 'VENTA'. The bank teller gives the cash directly to the shopkeeper. In addition, the shopkeeper can easily give a box of fake cigars from a bag or other source. Because the receipt comes from the bank counter and the client has signed for what is supposedly a cash advance, credit card companies (i.e. MasterCard) are reluctant to refund or complain against this particular (and very lucrative) merchant. The lesson for the tourist is to never let one's credit card out of one's hands, and even then in many places it is better to pay cash. Also, shops are less expensive after Customs than in the pre check-in lounge.
