Jacobi Kirke (St. James’s church) from 1150 on the town square, and the merchant houses Den Kampmannske Gaard from 1781, Den Palludanske Gaard from 1821, Den Schultz’ske Gaard from 1795, and Sillasens Hus on the town square from 1797. Many of the street layouts in the inner town are still as they were in the Middle Ages, and houses which have preserved their original character can be seen here. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["55.6333"],["8.4833"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["West Jutland"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Varde"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Varde"]]}]
