[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Veracruz"]}," is a large city in the state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Veracruz (state)"],["Veracruz"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Mexico"]]},".  The locals call their city \"Puerto\" (port) to differentiate the city from the state of Veracruz. The Port of Veracruz remains the core of its economy. It is also famous for its nightlife, and its spacious downtown area near the harbor (zocalo) comes alive with music and dancing with a strong Cuban influence. Highlights are the annual carnival celebrations around February when the party atmosphere is particularly raucous and hotel rooms become difficult to find.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nVeracruz has a rich history. It has been the main gate of the country for sea travelers and products since its foundation. In this region, the Spanish first entered Mexico in the 16th century and remained for three centuries, forever changing the region. About 20 km northwest from Puerto Veracruz, in a town known as La Antingua Veracruz, Hernán Cortés first landed in Mexico. Veracruz would be one of the main ports of the Spanish Treasure Fleets. From its harbor, Mexican silver and the Asian silks, porcelain and spices of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Acapulco"]]},"-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manila"]]}," galleon trade were loaded onto galleons for transport to Spain. San Juan de Ulua fortress, located on an island off the city's coast, was built in the 16th century to guard against pirate attacks. It was the scene of the final stand of Spanish colonialism in the New Spain, being occupied by Spanish soldiers for four years after Mexico's War of Independence. Veracruz has witnessed four foreign invasions, earning the city the title 'Cuatro Veces Heroica' \"Four times Heroic\". Two of these attacks led to full-scale invasions of Mexico which retraced the route of Cortés, by the U.S. in 1847 and France in 1862.  \n\nDespite its status as the oldest European settlement on the American mainland, much of the colonial city was destroyed by invasions. The city walls were demolished during the era of Porfirio Diaz. However, there is some significant historic architecture, including two historic fortresses, several museums, and historical buildings in the \"Malecon.\" \n\nA few beaches can be found north of Veracruz, but the beaches and water are not very clean; beach lovers might want to go north to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tecolutla"]]}," or south to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Tuxtlas"]]},".\n\nLocal language is, of course, Spanish.  More than half (but not all) of the hospitality workers speak English.\nLocal people are known as \"jarochos.\" This denomination is not only for the people of the city but for the whole region of the State of Veracruz, known as \"Llanuras de Sotavento.\" The jarochos are friendly people who love to be outdoors. The weather is mild, averaging between 25 and 32 degree Celsius, but between January and March high winds from the north known as \"nortes\" can reach up to 120 Km\/h.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nVeracruz has a small international airport. The only direct US flights are from Houston, Texas via United Airlines or Dallas\/Fort Worth via American Airlines. There are many options from other Mexican cities, including Mexico City. The airport is about 10km west of downtown.\n\nThe ADO bus station is located a short distance from the city centre. The bus trip from Mexico City TAPO terminal (located next to the San Lazaro metro station) takes 5 1\/2 hours. The bus trip from Puebla takes 3-4 hours.\n\nRailway has not been in operation for passengers since about 1995.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nArriving at the bus station, one can buy a voucher for a taxi. The station is located on Salvador Diaz Miron Street. The bus station is located only about 10 blocks (1 km) from one of the main tourist attractions of the city, \"Villa del Mar.\" It is about a 40-minute walk from the Zocalo.\n\nTaxis\nTaxis are very inexpensive. A journey costs between 2.50 and 5.00 USD according to the your zone destination.  Passengers are advised to agree to the cost before entering a taxi. \n\nWalking\nThe cheaper way to know the city is walking in the downtown and after that walk to the \"Malecon\" where several boats, historical buildings as well as tourist facilities and stores are located. \n\nBy bus\nOne very interesting possibility is to take the Bus \"Boca del Rio\", its path almost goes across the Boulevard of the City to the downtown of \"Boca del Rio\", a city joined in fact with Veracruz that has the better hotels, modern building and beaches of the Region. Almost the other public buses are not recommended for turist, because they are old, in bad conditions and often very crowded and its paths are not easy understandable for new people in the city.\n\nVeracruz brightly painted US school buses are used for city buses.

Seafood dishes include octopus and red snapper (huachinango) prepared a la veracruzana (a tomato-olive based sauce), \"arroz a la tumbada\" (tumbled rice) and \"caldo de mariscos\".
