During the roman rule, human occupation of this massif was limited to the surrounding slopes, principally in the Diois area. The plateaus where used only seasonally, for examples as a source of building stones (quarries in the high plateaus)\n\nDuring the middle ages, permanent dwelling and villages progressiviely appeared, starting in the XIth century. Middle age settlements started in the villages of la Chapelle, Saint Julien, Saint Martin and Saint Agnan, in what was called the \"Vercors valley\".\n\nDuring the XVIIIe century, the forest started to be exploited as one of the most valuable assets of the plateaus. One of the traces of those times is the name of the vertiginous pass at the bottom of the Combe Laval gorge, ",{"type":"''","value":["le col de la machine"]},", i.e. the pass of the machine. That \"machine\" was a kind of crane used to lower the logs from the Vercors plateau down the then impassable 300 m high cliffs.\n\nWood production from the thick forests of the Vercors was also very important in the XIXe century. By the end of that century, several roads, among the most vertiginous in the world, were dug in the cliffs of the Vercors primarily for wood transportation. Although intensive, and perhaps sometimes excessive, wood exploitation was not destructive, since the most important forest of those times (Lente, Coulmes) are still prosperous today. This is partly due to the long term management plans used in state forests (Foret domaniales) in France since the XVIIe century. \n\nDuring the XXe century, these mountains were used as a natural fort by the French Resistance during WWII. These resistant camps housed 400 combatants by the beginning of 1944, provisioned by locals who were mostly friendly. On June 6, 1944, the roads entering the mountain were closed, and the Vercors was declared a republic (",{"type":"''","value":["République du Vercors"]},"). In July 21, 1944, the mountain was attacked by 15,000 German soldiers by the roads, the small passes in the cliffs, and from the air. Resistants where only 3,500 at this time. 600 resistants and 200 civilians including women, childs and infants were killed, most in gruesome ways. The killing of civilians was especially horrible in the village of Vassieux, where S.S. troops killed all the inhabitants and destroyed the houses.\n\nA lot of competitions of the Winter Olympic games of 1968 (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grenoble"]]},") took place in the northern part of the park, especially in the villages of Villars de Lans, Saint Nizier du Moucherotte and Autrans.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nVercors is populated by both hills animals like stag (",{"type":"''","value":["cerf"]},"), roe deer (",{"type":"''","value":["chevreuil"]},"), common hare (",{"type":"''","value":["lièvre"]},"), and wild boar(",{"type":"''","value":["sanglier"]},"); and mountains animals like ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":WikiPedia:Capra ibex"],["ibex"]]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["bouquetin"]},"), chamois (same spelling), marmots (",{"type":"''","value":["marmotte"]},") and variable hare(",{"type":"''","value":["lièvre variable"]},").

Use extra caution if fog weather occurs, if for any reason the visibility is reduced, or if you walk away from designated path.\n\nSome of the more scenic roads are literally dug in cliffs, in gorges, etc. These roads are narrow, with sharp bends. Exercise caution, especially in bad weather.\n\nThe Vercors plateau is at a higher altitude than neighbouring cities such as Grenoble. As such, areas in Vercors may receive snow while there is none in these surrounding cities and valleys. Main roads get snowploughed, but secondary roads might not; some secondary roads may be closed in winter, and some roads may be accessible only with tire chains. Snow tires are strongly advisable in winter, but most rental agencies do not provide them by default.\n\nBecause of the Karstic nature of this mountain, water is scarce. If hiking, always carry more water than you think you need. \n\nIf snowshoeing, especially in slopy or isolated places, carry a shovel and an ARVA apparatus, in case of an avalanche.\n\nAlthough wolves have been noticed in the park, large mammals do not generally represent a risk.
