The life became quiet here since the middle of 19th century, after Vereya was left far from newly built railways. There are still some nice architectural buildings dating several centuries ago, many are in state of disrepair now. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nBy car: From Moscow either by M1 until the crossing with Mozhaisk - Vereya road, then turn to the south, or by M3 until Naro-Fominsk, then cross the town in the direction of Kubinka (look for both Kubinka and Vereya direction roadsigns), but don't miss left turn to Vereya some time after you'll cross the town.\nBy train: Nearest stations are Dorokhovo and Mozhaisk from Belorusskiy train station and Nara from Kievskii train station.
