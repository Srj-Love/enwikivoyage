Think charming cobblestoned streets with typically pastel-coloured Luxembourg mansions and a gorgeous ",{"type":"''","value":["Our"]}," valley backdrop. Vianden is a traveller's favourite and although high season will bring in some crowds, it's a most pleasant little town with a restaurant at every corner and all the fairytale atmosphere you could ask for. Coming here, you'll follow in the footsteps of countless celebrities, famously going back to Victor Hugo, who repeatedly spent time here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Grande Rue Vianden.JPG"],["thumb"],["Vianden's Grand-Rue, the main street."]]},"\nVianden's history goes far back, with a Gallo-Roma castellum preceding the current castle. The earliest documented mentions of the town, then called ",{"type":"''","value":["Viennensis"]},", date from the end of the 7th century. Building of the castle began in the 11th century and Vianden soon became the seat of the counts of Vianden, but the city gained its charter only in 1308. The town flourished in the Middle Ages, when it was known for its craftsmen, and later on for its leather works. The last leather tannery closed in the 1950's.\n\nThe power of the counts of Vianden was at its peak in the 13th century, and so was the grandeur of their castle. A Renaissance-style structure was added to the castle in the 17th century, but over time the state of the fort diminished with the stature of its lords. As Luxembourg fell under Dutch rule, the town became of little consequence, with earthquakes and a fire further damaging its castle. Things worsened when William I of the Netherlands, uninterested in Vianden and its castle, eventually sold the premises to a local merchant, who in turn sold off its interior piecemeal, leaving the place in ruins. There were several largely unfruitful attempts at restoration, but it was only in the late 1970's that serious repairs took place and the castle was returned to its former glory. For anyone who's interested in the town's history, a visit to the castle is a must-do, as it provides a wealth of information on the matter.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Vianden today "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:St Nicholas chapel Vianden.JPG"],["thumb"],["The St Nicholas Chapel, just across the street from the bridge, originates in the 13th century but was rebuilt in 1724 after a fire."]]},"\nThe revival of the castle immediately turned Vianden into a major tourist destination in the region. With its winding roads and rolling hills, the area around town is particularly popular among motorcyclists, who are welcomed by local establishments for the business they bring. On sunny summer afternoons the town can get a bit crowded and noisy because of the many motorbikes and visitors, but early risers will find a peaceful village even in high season.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourist Information Office"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.vianden-info.lu\/english\/home"],["email="],["address=1A, rue du Vieux Marché"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+352 83 42571"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Tu-F 08:00-12:00 & 13:00-17:00, Sa-Su & holidays 10:00-14:00"],["price="],["content=The tourist office has information on all the sights in and around Vianden, and it can arrange guided tours and make reservations for hotels or the adventure park.
