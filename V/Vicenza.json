The city and the surrounding countryside and hills are particularly famous for the many works, and particularly the Villas, by Palladio. Because of the architectonic contributions of Andrea Palladio, it was inscribed in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"]]}," in 1994.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nVicenza is an ancient city. In 157 b.D. it entered into the roman empire with the name ",{"type":"''","value":["Vicetia"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Vincentia"]},". In 889 it was destroyed by Ungari, and in 1001 it became an  episcopal stronghold. In 1404 it became part of the Republic of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Venice"]]},".\n\nThe XVI century was very important for Vicenza because Andrea Palladio built several villas and palaces. During the XIX century, after the fall of Napoleone, the city was taken by Austria, but in 1848 the citizens rebelled against the Austrian government and in 1866 it finally became part of the Kingdom of Italy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nThe train station is located on the southern part of the town, at the end of Viale Roma.  Piazza Castello and the old town is a mere 5-minute walk from the station.\n\nThe railstation of Vicenza is on the line connecting ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Milan"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Venice"]]},".  There are also a number of trains to other major cities and destinations such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bologna"]]}," to the south, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bolzano"]]}," to the north, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trieste"]]}," to the east via connections ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Verona"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Padova"]]},", Venice, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trento"]]},".\n\nTrains to the towns and cities around Vicenza depart daily (times provided are for the regionale trains).  The most common are to Verona (1 hour), Padova (25 minutes), Venice (1 hour 15 minutes).  Trains also depart for Bassano del Grappa, Treviso, Castelfranco, Rovigo, Sirmione, and Ferrara.\n\nTaking international trains from Vicenza is possible, but it could be slower and\/or more expensive since the city is not a major station for train transit.  Instead, it is highly recommended to book a train to France, Spain or Switzerland from Milan; Austria and Germany from Verona; and Eastern Europe from Venice. Book a separate (cheap) ticket to these cities and make your connection from there.\n\nMore info on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.trenitalia.com Trenitalia"]},".  When booking overseas train tickets, make sure to ask for the \"Smart\" special deal, which provides up to a 50% discount.  The deal is especially good for destinations in Eastern Europe such as Budapest or Belgrade, where tickets could be as low as 15 euros one-way (instead of 50 euros and above).  Trenitalia requires you to buy the ticket 7–15 days in advance, so make sure you plan your trip ahead of time.  The website only accepts Italian credit cards, so your best bet is to buy your ticket at the train station.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nVicenza could be reached via the following highways: A4 - from Torino, Milan, Venice or Trieste; A31 - from Schio, Asiago, and Bassano del Grappa; A22 - From Bolzano, Trento, Garda Lake, Mantova and Modena via Verona; A13 - from Bologna and Florence via Padova\n\nA number of strade statale (SS), strade regionale (SR) and strade provinciale (SP) criss-cross Vicenza, and they are a great way to reach many of the great small towns that surround Vicenza.  The roads going south to Colli Euganei through Colli Berici, to the northeast to Recoaro Terme, and to the northwest to Treviso via Bassano del Grappa and Asolo are particularly beautiful and highly recommended for those looking for drives through groves of olive trees, vineyards, hills, hidden valleys, and remote hill towns.  However, it is not recommended for going to major towns such as Verona, Padova, or Venice.

The bus station is located about 100 meters to the left of the train station.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\n\nIf you are up for it, it is easy to reach Vicenza via the smaller roads listed above via bicycle.  Cycling is a very popular activity in Italy, and many are even brave enough to attempt the alpine crossing from countries in the north to Italy.  Stay on the secondary roads however, as it is not only illegal but incredibly dangerous to ride your bicycle in the autostrada.  Also, do the trip from mid-Spring to late Summer as Northern Italy suffers very heavy fog during Autumn and Winter, and snow and ice conditions could be very dangerous and unpredictable especially in the mountains.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\n\nVicenza's city center is small enough to be comfortably explored on foot.  The main road through the old town is Corso Palladio, which contains the best of the city center's shopping as well as most of Palladio's urban palaces.  The hike from the city center to Monte Berico is uphill but still not so strenuous, and the road circles around to Villa Valmarana ai Nani down to the entrance to the Rotonda.

Spritz is originally an Austrian invention, owing to the region's former status as a part of the Austrio-Hungarian Empire.  Although there are as many versions of the drink as there are bars in the Veneto, the most common versions in Vicenza are made with prosecco, a splash of soda, Aperol or Campari, and a slice of orange.  Spritz Aperol tends to be sweeter, while Spritz Campari tends to be more bitter.  Prosecco, Italy's version of sparkling white wine, is cheap and common in the city due to its close proximity to the prosecco-producing areas in the northeast namely Asolo, Conegliano and Valdobiaddene.  Much like champagne (just don't call it \"Italian champagne\"!) the best prosecco tend to be smooth, producing smaller and more refined bubbles.  Unlike champagne, prosecco tends to be cheap regardless of quality.  Both drinks are usually consumed as aperitivi, but it isn't uncommon to drink only spritz or prosecco on a night out.\n\nGrappa is also a local product, with production concentrated in the northern hills close to Bassano del Grappa or in the Colli Berici.  It is usually consumed as a digestif or as a coffee-fortifier (\"caffe corretto\").  It is a strong liquor, but there tends to be little binge-drinking associated with it among the Italians.  Every fall, the city hosts ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.vicenzaqualita.org\/a_ITA_945_1.html Distillerie Aperte"]},", conducting tours and tastings of the best distilleries in the area.\n\nAlthough not as big as say production in Piemonte or Toscana, wine is still a major produce in the region.  The two most important variants are the Recioto from Gambellara and the Tai Rosso from the Colli Berici.  Both are labelled DOC, the Recioto receiving the highest and prestigious appellation DOCG.  For those who want to know more about these wines, the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.italiaoutdoors.com\/italy-veneto-region\/italy-veneto-vicenza.html?start=11 Strada del Vino Colli Berici"]}," and the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stradadelrecioto.com\/ Strada del Recioto"]}," link many of the province's best producers and provides opportunities to taste local wines alongside local produce and local countrysides.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Night Life"]},"\n\nThere isn't much in terms of night life in Vicenza per se, but the city is hardly dead on Friday nights and weekends.  Although the city can get downright depressing on winter nights, spring and summer signal an explosion of merriment, when young people come out again and fill the city's bars and clubs.\n\nIn the historic center, the Piazza dei Signori, Piazza delle Erbe and Contra Pescheria Vecchia are the liveliest, with big groups of young people hanging around until late hours on weekends.  Clubbing is an unknown activity in the center, instead concentrated in the SR 11\/SS 46 intersection (about ten minutes from the historic center).  Although a great place for a night out, featuring lively and sometimes packed clubs and live music, caution in this part of town should be exercised due to a moderate rate of crime associated with drugs, prostitution, illegal cabs, as well as general disturbance caused by public intoxication.  Nevertheless, it is a relatively safe place for a night out.\n\nFor English-speaking guests looking to make friends with local Italians, there is an English Speaking Hour every Thursday from 9PM until closing.  The location changes frequently, so check out the group's Facebook page ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/englishspeakinghappyhourvicenza"]}," for current information.
