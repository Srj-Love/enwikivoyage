It is located 234 miles (377 km) northwest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans"]]}," on the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers, and 40 miles (65 km) due west of Jackson, the state capital. Vicksburg is considered a cultural landmark in the American South and is home to the Southern Cultural Heritage Center, Vicksburg Military Park, and (opening soon) the Lower Mississippi River Museum.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe area which is now Vicksburg was previously part of the Natchez Native Americans' territory. The first Europeans who settled the area were French colonists, who built Fort-Saint-Pierre in 1719 on the high bluffs overlooking the Yazoo River at present-day Redwood. In 1790 the Spanish founded a military outpost on the site, which they called Fort Nogales (nogales meaning \"walnut trees\"). When the Americans took possession in 1798, they changed the name to Walnut Hills. A sprawling community developed which officially incorporated in 1825 as Vicksburg. It was named after Newitt Vick, a Methodist minister. Vicksburg experienced rapid growth during the expansion of the cotton trade in the American South. Cotton was grown most profitably in the Mississippi Delta region. Vicksburg sits at the southern most tip of the Mississippi Delta, and served as a production and commerce hub for the cotton industry. In the decades leading up to the American Civil War, Vicksburg became very affluent from the large number of Delta planters and merchants making considerable profits selling cotton to European and North American textile producers.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Vicksburg"]}," is most famous as the location of a 47 day siege during the American Civil War (May 18 – July 4, 1863). After federal naval forces on the Mississippi River made several attempts at passing the rebel batteries at Vicksburg, Ulysses S. Grant led the federal army on a campaign to put the Confederate garrison at Vicksburg to siege. The people of Vicksburg dug caves into the hillsides to survive the bombardment. The legacy of the siege lives through much of Vicksburg's art, museum exhibits and traditions.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Vicksburg"]}," was instrumental in the growth and propagation of American Blues music-- which is native to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mississippi"]]},". Blues evolved primarily in the Mississippi Delta region from the musical traditions of African-American slaves before the American Civil War. Vicksburg served as a central hub for musicians to perform for merchants and travelers in the music halls and \"juke joints\" near the river port at Vicksburg.\n\nToday ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vicksburg"]}," remains distinct as a place where travelers can experience the legacy and traditions of the American South in a quaint city overlooking the Mississippi River. The people of Vicksburg are very hospitable and love to pass down stories from generations past that will bring history to life. The pace of life remains much slower than in many other places in the United States. There are many activities in Vicksburg from cultural and historical venues, as well as historic Washington Street full of restaurants and consignment shops of antiques. Be sure to get out of the car and explore - Vicksburg has beautiful architecture and a warm, friendly environment for walking.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Vicksburg bridge over the mississippi morning-edit.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["Vicksburg bridge over Mississippi"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nInterstate 20 (E-W) or U.S. Highway 61 (N-S)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe closest commercial airport to Vicksburg is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jmaa.com\/ Jackson-Evers International Airport"]}]}," in Jackson, about 50 miles east on I-20 (or a little more than 85 kilometers).
