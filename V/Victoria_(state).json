Avalon is the other major airport and is located approximately 57 kilometres south-west of the centre and 23 kilometres north-east of Geelong, Victoria's second largest city. Avalon is domestic only and caters exclusively for the budget airlines. Both airports are serviced via bus. Tullamarine is notoriously expensive for car parking, especially short-term.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By boat "]},"\nVictoria is serviced regularly by one boat route, which travels between Victoria and the island state of Tasmania. The Spirit of Tasmania arrives daily (twice daily during peak season) at Station Pier in the inner-city suburb of Port Melbourne, approximately 6 kilometres south-west of the city centre. There is a regular light-rail service between the pier and city centre. To encourage tourism, the Tasmanian state government subsidises fares and it can be a relatively inexpensive way to get to Victoria, especially if you are taking a vehicle. If travelling without a vehicle, it is usually cheaper and more convenient to arrive by air. The boat offers deck travel or for a higher price cabins are available.
