CHP patrols the I-15 corridor in Victorville heavily.  The nearest city to the south is San Bernardino and Barstow to the north.  Several highways branch off from I-15; Highway 395 going west to Palmdale is a hilly two-lane highway for much of its length and is known for being quite dangerous with frequent CHP speed traps.  Highway 18 splits off of I-15 at D Street and continues through Apple Valley and on into Lucerne Valley and eventually Big Bear."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=B-V Link"],["url=http:\/\/vvta.org\/bvlink.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 760 948-3030"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M, W, Th 7:50AM-6PM"],["price=One way $6, round trip $12, seniors\/disabled are half price."],["content=Bus service between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barstow"]]}," and Victorville."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=California Route 66 Museum"],["url=http:\/\/www.califrt66museum.org\/"],["email="],["address=16825 D Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 760 951-0436"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Th-M 10AM-4PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Scandia Family Fun Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.scandiavv.com"],["email="],["address=12627 Mariposa Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 760 241-4007"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Winter: Su-Th 10AM-10PM, F-Sa 10AM-Midnight; Spring: Su-Th 10AM-11PM, F-Sa 10AM-1AM; Summer: Su-Th 10AM-Midnight, F-Sa 10AM-1AM; Fall: Su-Th 10AM-11PM, F-Sa 10AM-1AM"],["price=$19 (unlimited pass)"],["content=Go-kart racing, bumper boats, mini-golf and batting cages."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Days Inn Victorville"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.daysinncalifornia.com\/html\/days-inn-victorville.asp"],["email="],["address=15401 Park Ave East"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 760 241-7516"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hawthorne Suites"],["url=http:\/\/www.hawthorn.com\/reservations\/locationdetail.asp?facid=1817"],["email="],["address=11750 Dunia Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 760 949-4700"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 760 949-4737"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Extended Suites"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hotelextendedstudio.com\/"],["email="],["address=14786 Monarch Blvd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 760 843-3800"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price="],["content=A real sleeper.
