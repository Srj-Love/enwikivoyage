After World War Two many of the city's minorities had been exiled or killed and much of the city lay in ruin. When Austria was given sovereignty after the post World War Two occupation, it was eventually established that Austria was going the way of the West and not that of the Eastern Block. So the city became more isolated from its previous ties to its Slavic and Hungarian neighbors; the east of Austria was surrounded by the Iron Curtain. Vienna had gone from being the well established metropolitan city of Central Europe to the capital of a small, predominately German-speaking nation of states with strong regional identities.\n\nSince the formation of the first Austrian Republic and the first mayoral election 1919 the Social-Democratic Party of Austria has had the majority of representatives on the common council and controlled the mayoral seat. During the early years, the socialist ",{"type":"'''","value":["Red Vienna"]}," (\"Rote Wien\") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dasrotewien-waschsalon.at\/"]}," revolutionized the city, improving the extreme conditions that the industrial revolution and rapid urbanization had created. Most famously the city built many housing projects (housing estates or \"Gemeindebauten\"), and they also began to offer many social services and made improvements across the board in quality of life. The public housing that was built at that time is now famous for its distinctive style. To this day the city continues to build public housing and about a third of the city's residents live in it, some 600,000 people! Obviously through this high percentage, the quality, and the integration of public housing across the city have kept it from becoming as stigmatized as in most cities. The Viennese are used to having the city government in their lives, and of course have a love-hate relationship with it. Vienna functions on its own as a federal state in the Austrian system (along with 8 other states) and the sense of local pride and home is more of being Viennese than being Austrian, many say.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Culture"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Traditional Vienna"]}," is but one of the many façades of this city; the historic center, a UNESCO world heritage site, is sometimes begrudgingly compared to an open-air museum.

Old-fashioned Sterbevereine (funeral insurance societies-literally translated \"death clubs\") provide members with the opportunity to save up for a nice funeral throughout the course of their lives. This service does not exist solely to save their children the hassle and expense - it is considered absolutely mandatory to provide for an adequate burial. Vienna even has the \"Bestattungsmuseum\", a museum devoted to coffins and mortuary science. The country’s morbid obsession may be correlated with its higher suicide rate when compared with the rest of Europe.

One major complaint is that bicycle facilities were an afterthought and this is very apparent, many stop lights and intersections are dangerously or annoyingly set for bicyclists and paths are very illogical: they are sometimes on-street sometimes off, sometimes shared with pedestrians, sometimes not, and can vary or end out of nowhere. You are required by law to use a bike lane or path if there is one, unless it is blocked, otherwise regular traffic laws apply.

A small bilingual dictionary will be useful for trying to decipher menu listings:  at least it will enable you usually to determine what sort of food (chicken, beef, potato, etc.) is concerned, even if you can't tell how it's prepared.

Another good place to find snacks (especially while going out) is Schwedenplatz.\n\nBy far the cheapest way to get a fast food meal in Austria (and probably the only meal available for just over €1) is buying an Austrian sandwich (sliced brown bread + ham\/cheese + gherkin) from a supermarket. Supermarkets with a  deli counter (Feinkostabteilung) will prepare sandwiches to take away at no extra charge. You only pay for the ingredients. There is usually a large selection of meat products, cheese, and bread rolls available here, too. You point at the combination you want, can also mention the max total you can pay, and then pay at the cash register. One of the favorites is the \"Leberkässemel\", which is like a bigger but less dense version of a high quality hot dog on a bun. Freshness and quality at the grocery stores are normally better than at a sandwich stand on the street.\n\nAnother great way to eat on a budget is at one of Vienna's hundreds of bakeries.

There are male and female prostitutes, many from Austria's neighboring countries (few from Austria), but also from Africa, Latin America and Asia offering their services. Brothels differ greatly from small to the point one-room operations to hokey grad parlors. There is no true red-light district, but there are many 'bars' located on the 'Gürtel' as well as in the 2nd District, but they can be found everywhere. Street prostitution areas exist but should be avoided due to the low-regulation and high amount of trafficked and unregistered workers. There are plenty of go-go clubs as well though, that are not brothels. Some of these have male and female dancers dancing together and are frequented by men and women together.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nVienna is a major tourist hotspot ant offers a complete range of accommodation options. Prices are relatively higher than in neighboring countries, or even in the rest of Austria. Do note that Vienna, and especially its centre, has a very high percentage of historic buildings (dating from before the Second World War, most from the 19th-century ",{"type":"''","value":["Gruenderzeit"]},"), and they are in current use in. al. as hotels, pensions and hostels. This means that quite many offer relatively small rooms with sometimes compromised views, and rooms within the same property can vary widely, even at the same price.\n\nYou will probably find that Vienesse hotels usually offer very traditional decor, traditional bathrooms with bathtubs and, again, relatively space-limited quarters. There are very few \"modern design\" hotels, and those looking for American-style 30+ square metre rooms should do good research before booking and make sure their booked room matches the expectations. On balance, breakfasts in Vienna are usually relatively good, with a good variety of products, even at the less pricey establishments - moreover, you can count on many local cafes to offer you breakfast should your booking not include one.\n\nIn ",{"type":"'''","value":["choosing an accommodation"]}," it is important to know which part of the city you want to spend time in. Most accommodations claim to be centrally located, which for the Viennese would mean they should be in or next to the 1st District, few actually are. Many are even outside the core districts 2-9. Still, all of them are located within about a 5-minute walk to an underground or at least a rail or tram station, you can get to the center within 20 minutes or less on public transportation form anywhere in the city.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Smoking"]}," rooms are relatively common. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Non-smoking"]}," rooms are in limited supply, and hotels with non-smoking floors are less common. Sensitive non-smokers may be bothered that public areas of the hotel (often the hallway outside your room) are often heavy with tobacco smoke.\n\nDuring the summer there can be several days where the temperature is over 30 C.  There are very few hotels that have air conditioning.  People who are used to sleeping in a cool environment should seek out hotels that have air conditioning or schedule their trips during those times of the year when the temperature will be cooler.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet"]},"\nVienna has a large number of mostly free wireless hotspots in bars, restaurants, and cafés (see drink section). Wifi is known locally as ",{"type":"''","value":["WLAN"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Wireless LAN"]},". Those that are on the Freewave Wi-Fi network ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.freewave.at freewave.at"]}," can be found here: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.freewave.at\/en\/hotspots"]},". MuseumsQuartier has free wireless internet. There are plenty of internet cafes except for in the first district. Touch-screen media terminals are available (including internet) in many phone booths, much of the content about Vienna is free.\nIf you plan to visit also places outside from the city and you don't want to stay without internet it's recommended to buy a prepaid 3G-simcard (all providers offers fast 3G service, also in rural and remote areas of Austria) and put it in your smartphone or internet USB stick. Download is mostly around 5-6 Mbit\/sec and upload 2-3 Mbit. (for HSDPA). The monthly cost for mobile internet is between 4 euro (1GB) and 15 euro (unlimited) (August 2011). The best 3G coverage in rural areas is from A1 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.a1.at a1.at"]},".

The ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.viennareview.net\/ Vienna Review"]}]}," offers a more indepth examination of local issues. International papers are widely available.

There are no slums or districts you should avoid. In general, you can visit any part of the city at any time of the day without taking many risks — just use your common sense. At night, though, it is wise to avoid parks. The drug scene at Karlsplatz (underneath the Opera) hangs out there during the day, but they do not care at all about tourists. Just ignore them and they will ignore you. The Prater (fair grounds\/amusement park area) is said by some locals to be less safe at night, though more in reference to pickpockets than anything else.  As in any major city, watch out for ",{"type":"'''","value":["pickpockets"]}," who grab and run when boarding the U-Bahn. Petty crimes (like jackets 'going missing') are more common and normally go unreported and won't get much sympathy. There have been a very few ",{"type":"'''","value":["racist assaults"]}," in Vienna (even some by the police themselves). One runs the risk of being pickpocketed. Schwedenplatz, along the Ring, is sleazy in the evenings, but basically harmless; the Stadtpark, along the Ring, to the East, is a bit deserted at night and therefore best avoided.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Prostitution"]}," is legal, even on the street, and is common around the area of the Prater. Ironically, some of the areas are stones thrown from the UNODC Headquarters (the UN agency responsible for combating human trafficking) and are human trafficking hubs for all of Europe. Many of these prostitutes are not registered and a high number are known to be trafficked, so take care if seeking their services. It is safer for everyone involved to visit a brothel. Women dressed in a certain manner walking around these areas alone at night might feel uncomfortable being checked-out in a certain way but there is no real danger. (There is no male street-prostitution to speak of in Vienna.)\n \nThere have been some reports of ",{"type":"'''","value":["fraud"]}," around Karlsplatz and the Ring. The usual scenario is that someone will stop you and ask for directions. A couple of other guys show up claiming to be police, showing a badge (must be fake). They ask if you were getting drugs from the other guy and then will ask for your passport and wallet for verification. When you are busy trying to convince them that your passport is valid, one of them sneaks out some money from your wallet. Best to tell them that you want to go to the police station — there is one at Karlsplatz U-Bahnstation. It's a minor annoyance, but it's better to be careful. In a different case of fraud they try to convince you that your money is counterfeit money and that they have to inspect it. As always use common sense: police are taught to approach you in a very distinctive way (you will notice if they do so), the badge must have ",{"type":"''","value":["Polizei"]}," ([ˌpɔlɪˈʦaɪ̯] police) and the Austrian coat of arms  and\/or the Austrian flag located somewhere on it, and they will be willing to bring you to the police station or a properly uniformed officer.\n\nDo not walk on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["bike lanes"]}," and cross them like you would cross any other road. Some bike lanes are hard to recognize (e.g. on the \"Ring\" in Vienna) and some cyclists bike rather fast. Walking on bike lines is not only considered impolite but it is illegal and you run the danger of getting hit.\n\nIf you see people ",{"type":"'''","value":["gambling"]}," on the streets (usually in popular tourists' destinations like Stephenplatz or Mariahilferstrasse), stay away! The modus operandi usually involves a guy playing the classic game of \"hiding the ball\". This involves covering the ball (or small trinket) with either a bottle cap or a match box and swirling it around with two other bottle caps asking people to guess the position of the ball. The game is set in a way that you can easily see the ball's position. This is done to lure the unsuspecting person into placing a wager. There are usually two main players and, between them, they will lose and win money back and forth to give the appearance that it is a fair game - do not be tricked! They are from the same gang. Once you get greedy and get lured in, you will surely lose your money! The person in control of the bottle caps will remove the ball from their position through sleight of hand and you will never see your money back. Besides the two or three other players involved, there are usually at least two lookouts - one on each side of 'stage'. Vienna has plenty of legal casinos if you care to try your luck.\n\nIn addition, it is common for suspicious persons to approach you in the city centers if you are standing still for a while (particularly if eating at outdoor tables). They will be holding magazines for sale, and will ask you if you are interested in looking at one for free. They are typically very aggressive in their demeanor. Do not be fooled by them! It is not free. If you look at the magazine for free, they will refuse to take the magazine back and demand payment for it at a high cost (typically 2 euros, which is the price of local homeless' magazines in Austria like \"",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.augustin.or.at\/ Augustin"]},"\", but they are in German anyways and it indeed has become a trend among non-related people to abuse the idea). The best response in this situation is, when they first approach, to simply wave your hands demonstratively to say no while shaking your head and repeat the phrase \"Nein danke\" ([naɪ̯n ˈdaŋkə] no thank you) to them repeatedly until they leave. If police are nearby, these people may accuse you of stealing the magazine, but many police know of their trickery so stand your ground. However, the best response in all cases is simply to dismiss these beggars by saying \"Nein danke\" and refusing to take the magazine. They will often look for tourists or people who look as though they are visiting hoping to make a sale; therefore, be prepared to tell them \"Nein danke\" as necessary so that they will leave you alone. They are not violent and just trying to get money from you, so do not be afraid that they will hurt you if you tell them no.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["|-"],["| style=\"vertical-align:top;width:50%;\" |"],[{"type":"*","value":["
