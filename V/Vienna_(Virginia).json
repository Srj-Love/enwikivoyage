Vienna does have a metro stop, its the end of the line for the D.C. metro's Orange line, however it is almost two miles from the center of town.  Buses run the length of the town up and down Maple Avenue, the defacto main street.  It is also worth noting that \"down town\" Vienna is small enough to get around on a bike or on foot, but its a car that will get you in and out of the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Wolf Trap"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.wolftrap.org\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A performing arts center located on national park land.
