You can buy a taxi coupon before you leave the airport building. Rides to the airport should be cheaper. From city to airport, a tuk-tuk is around 30,000 kip (Jun 2013). Do not agree to 55,000 kip, as shown on a price list by some tuk-tuk drivers, as they can bargained down to 30,000 kip. Always agree with the price before boarding the tuk-tuk. You can book up to one day in advance and ask the driver to pick you up at your hotel. If you don't mind walking the distance between the airport and the main road (less than 500 m), you can take a local bus for less than USD1.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe railway link across the Mekong has four shuttle services daily from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nong Khai"]]}," to Tha Naleng, which is 13 km from Vientiane and within reach by shuttle bus from the Morning Market. The trains are timed to connect with overnight trains to and from Bangkok, with around 90 minutes buffer time at the Thai side of the border for buying tickets and Immigration. It's thus possible to hop aboard Express 69 at 20:00 in Bangkok, arrive at Nong Khai at 09:30 and reach Tha Naleng around 10:30. The train has first and second class air-con sleepers, which cost around 1,200\/800 baht respectively. Check  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.railway.co.th State Railway of Thailand"]}," for up-to-date timetables and fares, as well as on-line ticket booking. A Lao visa on arrival is available at Tha Naleng station, though you need to arrange your own onward transport to get into the city. This is a major drawback as the station, unlike Friendship Bridge, is in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThe other option is to get off the train at Nong Khai and cross the border by bus via the Friendship Bridge. The Nong Khai station is just 1.5 km from the bridge, so if you take a tuk-tuk it should cost no more than 30-40 baht, after bargaining of course. Outside the station there's an information board listing the official prices to nearby destinations. Most tuk-tuk drivers will stop at a travel agent just outside the station and try to coerce you to buy both a Lao visa and shuttle bus to Vientiane. Don't listen to them: you can get a visa and shuttle easily at the Lao border.\n\nFor those who already have a Lao visa, or do not need one for a short visit such as citizens of ASEAN countries, Russia and a few others, getting off the train in Udon Thani then taking direct cross-border bus to Vientiane bus is a good option.\n\nThe train trip either way is pleasant if basic if you have a sleeper (less than 800 baht). You usually don't need air-con as the train isn't hot, though non-air-con often isn't available. A few cold-blooded travellers do say the air-con is too cold. Pack your own meals, beer, etc. The food on the train is expensive, and beyond awful. There is a change racket operating among the catering staff. Being short-changed is common. You need to note the prices on the menu, have baht (USD or kip will result in a big loss on the exchange rate) and have small denominations (a 1,000 baht note can serve an excuse for a 9-hour delay in bringing change. Even then you will have to go looking for it).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["From Thailand"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Saphan Mittaphap"]},") from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nong Khai"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]}," is the most common means of entry. The bridge cannot be crossed on foot or by bicycle (however, people have been seen strolling the bridge), but there are frequent 20 baht shuttle buses just past Thai immigration. (The price changes depending on the time of day and day of week. You will get a receipt.) Bicycles can be carried on buses in the cargo compartment.\n\nDirect buses to\/from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nong Khai"]]}," (55 baht), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khon Kaen"]]},"(180 baht) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Udon Thani"]]}," (80 baht) arrive and depart from the Morning Market (Talat Sao) bus terminal. These are cheap, comfortable, hassle-free, and popular, so book ahead or arrive early. Schedules change often. Currently the buses start at 08:00 and leave every 2 hours or so, until 18:00. Note: these buses are not an option if you plan to obtain a Lao visa on arrival at the bridge. The bus will not wait long enough. To get from the Udon airport to the Friendship Bridge, a 200 baht minibus fare can be purchased in the airport and will drop you off on the Thai side of the bridge.\n\nVisas on arrival are available at the bridge. If you forgot your passport photo, they'll photocopy your passport for an extra USD1\/40 baht (or do it on the Thai side for just 2 baht). When you get a visa on arrival, you get the entry stamp at the same time, so you don't have to wait in line afterwards. A 40 baht (or 9,000 kip) entry fee is sometimes charged once through. Just walk past the entry fee booth. If no one stops you, you haven't done anything wrong.\n\nOnce through immigration, you can take a jumbo (posted price 250 baht, easy to bargain down to 100 baht or less for immediate departure with only one passenger) or taxi (300 baht) to any destination in the city. Shared jumbos are cheaper. You should be able to negotiate to a good deal less than 50 baht\/person if you're prepared to share (and possibly wait).\n\nThe local bus (usually Bus 14) to Talat Sao (Morning Market) is the cheapest of all, 5,000 kip or 20 baht, but signs are nonexistent and you may be in for a wait (up to 20 minutes). The bus runs until at least 18:45 or so. It's about 25 km from the bridge to Vientiane; allow at least 30 minutes.\n\nWhen arriving via the Friendship Bridge, you might like to visit the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Nearby"],["Buddha Park"]]}," sculpture garden before going on to Vientiane, and save yourself a return trip back past the border crossing later. The same local bus (usually Bus 14) that connects Talat Sao (Morning Market) and the Friendship Bridge checkpoint also continues on to Buddha Park. Ask the driver which way he's going, just in case.\n\nBridge immigration shuts quite late, around 22:00. (Ambulances can go through at any hour, in an emergency.) But check with the locals if you are unsure.\n\nKhon Kaen-Vientiane direct bus, 185 baht each way, departs twice daily from Khon Kaen Bus Terminal (Prab-argat) at 07:45 (usually delayed till 08:00) and arrives at Vientiane Talat Sao Bus Station around 12:00. A second bus departs at 15:15.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From Vietnam"]},"\nA direct bus from Hanoi takes at least 20 hours (despite what the travel agents might say it averages 24 hr) and should cost about USD15-20. There is a twice weekly VIP bus (better seats) and a local bus that departs every day. With the local bus you're not certain of a seat and Vietnamese people tend to sit and never get up again until arrival.\n\nThe journey from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hue"]]}," is 14-18 hr and should cost USD20-30. The bus arrives to Southern Terminal where you have to bargain hard with tuk-tuks. The ride to town after midnight is 30,000 kip. There are local buses heading towards town from here that usually stop at the central market priced at about 10,000 kip.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From Cambodia"]},"\nThe bus trip from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phnom Penh"]]}," to Vientiane costs about USD50 if you go VIP. This means you get a sleeper (bed) for the night portion of your trip. Unless, however, you have a partner you will share the rather small bed with a random passenger of the same gender. The bed is comfortable, though there have been reports of leaking windows and flooded mattresses.\n\nAt the Lao-Cambodian border, essentially the same form has to be filled out numerous times (to ensure each official gets his fee). If you can't carry your luggage 500 m from the Cambodian border post to the Lao, you're out of luck. The bus staff will have disappeared by now. The border process is hot, slow, and enervating.\n\nRegardless of what the travel agent or bus company tells you, the Phnom Penh-Vientiane (or return) trip usually involves four separate buses, not two. The Phnom Penh-Lao border and Pakse-Vientiane legs are comfortable enough. However, between the border and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pakse"]]}," (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern Laos"]]},") you will be crammed into a minibus or open van, sit on other people's laps, etc., as the vehicle does the rounds of every guesthouse in the region. You will eventually be transferred into another van, and the process repeated. It can take 4-6 hours, and it is seldom clear where you are, where you are going, or who is in charge.\n\nIf the bus staff talks you into putting your luggage on a second bus, because of space problems,  it is liable to vanish along the road. The bus trip between Phnom Penh and Vientiane averages 27 hours.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From elsewhere in Laos"]},"\nBuses to and from destinations in Vientiane Prefecture depart from the Talat Sao bus terminal, just east of the Morning Market. There is an informative schedule and schematic diagram of the bus station painted on the central building, which is where you can also buy tickets.\nThe Southern Bus Terminal, used by all buses coming from the south (including VIP buses), is on Kaisone Phomvihane Rd, the first stretch of Rte 13 South, quite far from town (10 km northeast of the centre), leaving you at the mercy of the tuk-tuks (starting from 15,000 kip if you are lucky). Public Bus 23 stops by the entrance of the southern bus station and connects it with the Talat Sao bus terminal (Morning Market) at 5,000 kip, from where it is a ten-minute walk into the tourist centre. Mind that the existence of the city buses is going to be vigorously denied by most people you ask, as many have stakes in passenger transportation, and want you to take their ride instead.\n\nThe Northern Bus Terminal, somewhat northwest of the city centre on the T2 Road (now officially named Asiane Road), is where all buses to the north arrive and depart.\n\nIf you buy a bus ticket in town, with quite a surcharge, it should include the transfer to the respective terminal.\n\nIf you're coming from Luang Prabang, you can catch an overnight VIP bus for around 130,000 kip booked from any of the agents in town. Prepare for an uncomfortable, bumpy, winding journey with a 01:30 rest stop for a free bowl of soup with noodles at some unmarked place in the middle of nowhere before being dumped in Vientiane at 06:30.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nGetting around Vientiane is generally easy, as the traffic is far less murderous than in larger Southeast Asian cities like Bangkok or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ho Chi Minh City"]]},". Street signs are rather lacking, although in the centre more and more signs are appearing. Where there are signs displaying street names they are bilingual in Lao and French. The Lao word \"thanon\" on these signs is translated by \"road\", \"rue\", \"avenue\" or \"boulevard\", in many cases without any apparent logic. Because most travellers may go straight to the restaurant and hotel listing and not read this paragraph, \"road\" or \"Rd\" is used instead of \"thanon\".\n\nWhen asking for directions or streets with \"r\" in them, be aware that Laotians, as do the Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Cambodians, pronounce \"r\" as \"l\" (\"plied lice\" rather than \"fried rice\"). An example is Rue Setthathirat pronounced as \"Lue Setthathilat\".\n\nPerhaps because they are shy about their English skills, most locals are \"dumb\" on street directions, even people in police uniforms.\n\nMaps covering the city are available at bookshops and some mini-marts, but are not as detailed and not always to scale. Many shopfronts feature addresses in Roman letters, and these are often the best way to determine the street one is walking. People navigate using landmarks, so name the nearest embassy, hotel or temple near where you want to go.\n\nSince 2006 a major road upgrade project has been going on in the town centre and out of it up to past the airport in the west and the Friendship Bridge in the east, financed by the Japanese government and planned and overseen by Japanese engineers. Largely gone are the hazards presented by missing drainage gully covers and pavements upturned by tree roots. Almost no trees have been cut down. In the centre of Vientiane the through roads Setthathirat Rd and Samsenthai Rd and the side roads connecting them and down to the river now have sealed surfaces and sidewalks, and there is decent street lighting. A one-way traffic regime is in place (but the police are not enforcing it), and parking regulations have also been introduced. Markings for ",{"type":"'''","value":["pedestrian crossings"]}," have been painted on the new roads, but the local drivers regard them as decoration. Don't rely on them!\n \nVientiane's rainwater drainage system, which also includes \"grey water\" from baths, sinks, laundries, etc., consists of gullies on the roadside, usually covered by concrete slabs. These slabs are sometimes damaged and very precariously balanced or even missing altogether. People rapidly learn to take care before stepping on anything that looks like a slab. Waste from toilets is, or should be, collected in septic tanks (at every house), but those gullies can nevertheless smell abominably. In the centre things have improved markedly as a result of the road upgrading. The smell from the gullies is now no longer very noticeable.\n\nDo not rely exclusively on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Google Earth"]}," view of Vientiane for locating the sights: many locations put there by well-meaning users are clearly in the wrong place, not just a block or so away, but some even in a wrong part of the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nVientiane has a small fleet of genuine taxis retired from Bangkok, usually found lurking at the Friendship Bridge, the airport or in front of large hotels. Fares are set by bargaining, so figure on around USD0.50 per km or USD20-40 to hire one for the day, depending on car type and distance.\n\nTaxi Vientiane Capital Lao Group Co. Ltd. (+856 21 454168, +856 21 454088, 90 Nongbone Rd) advertises 20,000 kip for the first kilometre, then 2,000 kip every 300 m thereafter.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By tuk-tuk or jumbo"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Vientiane Jumbo.JPG"],["thumb"],["A typical jumbo (tuk-tuk) in Vientiane"]]},"\n\nTuk-tuks and their bigger cousins, jumbos, are ubiquitous in Vientiane. If chartering a tuk-tuk\/jumbo, make sure of the fare in advance. Short hops within the city should not cost more than 10,000 kip per person. In most cases, foreigners will find it difficult to get bargain prices. All the tuk-tuk drivers carry a fare card for popular destinations but these fares are ridiculously inflated. Do not pay these bogus, published fares. Walking away can make the fare drop quickly. Shared jumbos running on set routes, e.g., Lan Xang Rd to Pha That Luang, charge a fixed 10,000 kip. Tuk-tuks lined up at Mekong riverside restaurants or other busy areas will try to charge you 30,000-50,000 kip even for short trips. It's not worth trying to bargain as they won't go anywhere for a normal (10,000 kip) fare. Walk a few blocks and you get a much lower price.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nOld blue-and-white buses and newer white minibuses connect the centre to the suburban districts, but they are not equipped with air-con and have no signage in English, although route numbers are usually (not always) posted on the front. The only bus likely to be of use to the casual visitor is the bus to\/from the Friendship Bridge, which continues on to Buddha Park for a fixed fare of 5,000 kip.

Although the city's flat terrain makes for good biking, one-way streets can be difficult to identify. You can usually choose to leave your passport, your driver's licence, about 1,000 baht, or a comparable amount of kip or dollars as a deposit.\nDespite the poor standard of local driving, cycling is fairly safe in the city because the traffic is quite slow.

The monument itself aside, the palm tree-lined park around it complete with fountains is quite pleasant though lacking of shade during the daytime. You can climb up to the 7th storey, stairs only, for a nice view of central Vientiane and three levels of souvenir shops with less than enthusiastic sales people sitting about. It features a musical fountain nearby that attracts visitors from around Laos and Asia, as well as a World Peace Gong presented by Indonesia.

All serve inexpensive (but not really cheap for Laos) Lao, Thai, and some Western food. Among the best is the grilled fish, served by many of them. Take care when you're in for boiled eggs: what you get here are incubated duck eggs. When you open them you're in for a surprise (but at least the little bird does not chirp). The Lao love them and they are hugely popular. In 2005 one of the restaurants along the river put ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lao-style"]}," reed mats on the ground with low rattan \"tables\" (",{"type":"''","value":["kantoke"]},"). Diners sit cross-legged on the mat around the table. These became so popular that they can now be found at many of these establishments. They are much nicer than the rickety metal tables and plastic chairs that are the standard of all but the better restaurants in Laos. The riverside open-air restaurants have been known to use two menus, a cheaper one for locals and an expensive one for foreigners."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Ban Anou Night Market"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Has some of the best cheap meals in the city despite being only about 1 block long.
