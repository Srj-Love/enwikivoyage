It is a relatively small, rural island about 8 miles east of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Rico"]]},". It is about 22 miles long and 4 miles wide.\n\nVieques maintains a rural character, despite increasing tourist interest. Horses and chickens run wild in the streets. Expect to hear roosters and dogs during the night and morning while you're trying to sleep.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\nVieques is an island municipality  of Puerto Rico with two main towns. \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Isabel Segunda"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Isabel II"]}," is where most of the island's population lives.

For many years, the island was home to a major U.S. naval base, which used it for training, storage of munitions, and even target practice. During the early years of this century, there was a major dispute about the continued operation of the facility.  As a result, most of the area formally controlled by the military was turned over to the US Park Service. While there are still many restricted areas, a large part of the former military base is now open to the public.\n\nTwo locals, one PR born and one NY born, expressed the same concern - that the years of Navy munitions target practice both on land and off shore created a chemical drift which has contaminated the soil, causing higher than normal incidences of cancer.  Presumably due to this, in Esperanza, there is no locally caught fresh fish and no locally grown fruits and vegetables.  All food, including the water, is brought in from the PR mainland, greatly increasing the cost of living.\n\nBecause of this past, the island was by-passed for major development. Instead of lots of chain hotels and condos, one discovers an undeveloped Caribbean island. This is what makes the bioluminiscent bay (discussed below) one of the most vivid in the world. It also means that it is possible to find a remote beach where few will disturb you during an entire day. (The beaches are named for colors--presumably given by the military.) These beaches are accessed by dirt and gravel roads off the main roadways. Rent a small truck, tracker, or 4X4 to get to the best beaches.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spanish phrasebook"],["Spanish"]]}," is the working language of locals.

The ferry from Fajardo will cost about $2 per person and takes 60-90 minutes.  Tickets for the Passenger Ferry cannot be purchased ahead of time via the internet, rather you have to show up at the ticket booth at your departure point 1 hour early and buy them at the ticket window. It is advised to be there early, especially on weekends, when it might be helpful to be at the dock at least an hour prior to departure, (and that's assuming you already have your tickets). The ferry usually begins loading 30 minutes prior to departure. Pets are allowed on the passenger ferry, but, not under the air conditioned area, they need to be on a pets cage and ride on the non\/air conditioned areas of the ferry. You are normally allowed to whatever you can carry (with the exception of any items containing gas) i.e. such as a lawn mower or grass trimmer that has been used. Passengers can ride inside the ferry where is nicely air conditioned - maybe too much - or on the upper deck where you can enjoy one of the most beautiful scenery of the surrounding big island of Puerto Rico, and other interesting places like the Conquistador Hotel, Palomino island, Culebra, and of course, a few sailboats, etc.  Bicycles must go on the Cargo Ferry.  It is recommended that you rent an automobile in the island of Vieques versus trying to bring your own car.  Space is not always available for cars on the Cargo Ferry, unless you have booked at least a month in advance, however, if you'd like to take a chance, you can get to the port 2 to 3 hours before departure and get yourself on stand-by.\n\nIn March 2012, ferry service was intermittant and unreliable.
