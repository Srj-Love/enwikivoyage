At the time of Spanish colonisation, the Chinese settlers, whose language was Southern Fujianese (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minnan phrasebook"],["Minnan"]]},", often referred to as \"Hokkien\" by most Filipinos), referred to the area as \"Bee Gan\" (Chinese: 美岸; pinyin: Měi'àn), which means \"Beautiful Shore.\" Since the Castillian and Basque Spanish conquistadors interchanged V and the B to refer to the B sound, they spelled the Hokkien Chinese name \"Bee Gan\" as \"Vigan\", which is the name used to this day.\n\nIn pre-colonial times, Vigan was an important trading post for Chinese merchants trading gold, beeswax and other products from the central Cordilleras for exotic Asian goods. Many Chinese traders settled in the ",{"type":"''","value":["mestizo"]}," district, marrying locals and starting new bloodlines.\n\nVigan was captured and settled by the Spanish in 1572, and grew to become a centre of Spanish political and religious power in the north of Luzon. In 1758 Vigan became the Seat of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia.\n\nInterestingly the town was also a hotbed of anti-Spanish politics. Diego Silang was perhaps the most notable resistance leader, but was assassinated by his friends (on commission from the Spanish) in May 1763. Undeterred, Silang's wife, Maria Josefa Gabriela Silang, assumed leadership of the uprising but was later captured by the Spanish and publicly hanged in on September 20, 1763.\n\nLocal legend has it that Vigan got its name from a simple communication breakdown. A Spaniard walking along the Metizo River apparently met a local and asked which the city's name. Not understanding what he was being asked, but seeing that the Spaniard seemed to be pointing to a tree, replied \"Bigaa Apo\" (a giant Taro plant that was common in the area). It is from the word \"Bigaa\" that Vigan is said to have derived its name.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\nVigan is a relatively small city with two hearts: the recreational and shopping area around the adjacent Plaza Salcedo and Plaza Burgos in the north, and the commercial centre around the public market in the south.
