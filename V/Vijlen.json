The surrounding hamlets included, some 1500 people live here, although in summer the village also receives a large number of visitors. Mostly Dutch tourists find their way to this friendly village, which serves as a fine base to explore the region. It is known as the highest situated village in the Netherlands and is commended for the beautiful landscapes and forest areas around. It promotes itself as the only \"mountain village\" in the country, which of course is an exaggeration of its hill top position, but is the basis for a number of activities for tourists and inhabitants alike.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Vijlen-Rott 48 (3).JPG"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Typical timber framed houses are common in the hamlets around Vijlen"]]},"The village of Vijlen comrpises the hamlets Camerig, Harles, Rott, Melleschet and Cottessen.

If accommodation gets scarcer during the summer season, or if you like the countryside experience, these hamlets have a number of camp sites and holiday houses to offer. The main village of Vijlen is located on a hill, the Vijlenerberg, and therefor lies up to 200 meters above Normaal Amsterdams Peil.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nBurial mounds in the nearby Vijlener forest are proof of human settlement in this area at the time of the Linear Pottery Culture, some 3000–5000 years ago. Children's teeth were found in one of the mounds, which is therefor called the \"children's grave\". Since no valuable items were found at the site, but Roman pottery remains were, the Romans are believed to have plundered the graves long before their excavation in the 1920s and 30's. The modern day village is most likely Roman in origin, and the name Vijlen is presumably derived from \"villa\" or \"villare\", which would mean \"farm villa\" or \"belonging to a farm villa\" in Latin.\n\nAround 1877, ",{"type":"'''","value":["cement industry"]}," settled in the small village. A factory was build on top of the Vijlenerberg (the hill on which the village lies) and made a natural cement out of local limestone. A second factory was build in 1899, lower on the hill, but went bankrupt soon after. A new owner was able to get the new factory running again and made good profits during World War I, when cement became scarce. Both factories had underground tunnels, originally for underground mining purposes and later to connect open air quarries to the factory buildings. A long 2 meter high and no more than 1.7 meter broad tunnel under the Vijlenerberg connected the new factory to its quarry. In the 1920s, strong competition in the cement branch and the remote location, far from any railway, eventually caused the factories to close.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe main road leading to Vijlen is a side way of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["N278"]}," (between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maastricht"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vaals"]]},").
