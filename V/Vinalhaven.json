Ferry tickets for pedestrians are $17.50.\nThe Ferry ride is a little more than 75 minutes.  But unlike the plane or bus, you're not restricted to your seat.  Riders effectively have free reign on deck and on the lookout landing below the bridge.  And be sure you take advantage of it.  The ride is fantastic (albeit impossibly windy and frequently cold).  You'll pass two lighthouses, uncountable sailboats, and catch your only unfettered view of the Fox Islands on one side and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Camden (Maine)"],["Camden"]]}," hills on the other.  If you're really lucky, you might even glimpse an elusive seal (although they give the ferries a wide berth).\n\nIf for whatever reason you miss the 4:30 Vinalhaven Ferry, there is a contingency plan.  You can catch a 5:15 ferry to North Haven Island.  The ride is a about as long and even more interesting.  When you arrive in North Haven, walk down the road to Brown's Boat Yard, and ask around for a skiff ride to the other side.  People are generally friendly, and you shouldn't have a problem finding a lift.  They'll run you across the sound to the North Coast of Vinalhaven.  The going rate for a ride is circa $5USD.  When you arrive, you'll find your cell-phone is probably useless, so there's a payphone where you can call into town and ask for a ride.  If you don't know anyone in town, good luck to you--it's about a two hour walk with luggage.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nWith careful logistical planning, it is possible to get a car onto the island, but be sure you have at least three days to waste each way.  There are 4 automobile reservations for three of the six boats and you must get them one month in advance in person at the ferry terminal when they open or by calling the ferry terminal from which you are departing no earlier than 9:30 AM.  In the summer months, the reservations are gone before the earliest time you can call for them.  Best advice: don't bother with it.  If you MUST have a car on the island, ask a terminal employee where you should put your car to get in line.  You can usually get on within 2-3 ferries of when you put your car in line.  If there aren't 2-3 ferries left in the day, just sleep in you car (or you can run across the street to the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.navigatorinn.com\/ Navigator Inn"]}]}," if you must), but ",{"type":"'''","value":["KEEP YOUR CAR IN THE LINE."]},"  If you leave, you lose your place in queue.  You'll get onto the first boat 90% of the time because many VH residents put their cars in line, ride the last boat home, ride the first boat back the following morning, and catch the second in their car.  This means that the first of the day is the least competitive. \n\nReturning from the island is even more convoluted.  You must get to the ferry terminal the day before to get a line number, which is a guaranteed spot on a ferry.  The numbers are issued at 5:30 AM the day before departure and in the summer months, people will line up at 3 AM or earlier to get themselves on the boat they want.  It is more difficult to get a spot on the morning boats because the locals who are running errands use the early boats in order to return that day.  There are people who will get a line number for you for about $30 - $40 if you value a nights sleep in bed more than a nights sleep in your car at the ferry terminal.\n\nIf all this is too much, forget it all.  The island itself is only 5 miles long by 7 miles wide (in a crescent shape), with 49 miles of paved road.  This means that for any given journey, you'll never need to go more than 5 miles (or thereabouts).  Despite the way the locals seem to drive, walking on the roads is a safe means of transportation.  You can also rent some pretty disreputable bikes from the Tidewater (free if you're staying there, $10\/day otherwise).  But by and large, you'll have no trouble hoofing it wherever you need.  Additionally, most of the tourist-catering business folk are perfectly happy to pick you up wherever you are and bring you to their services (and the nice ones will take you back or drop you off wherever you need).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Lane's Island"]}," - Protected by the Nature Conservancy, this beautiful preserve is a must-see.
