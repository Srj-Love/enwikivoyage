These carvings are found especially on the Reef Bay hiking trail. These people were all but driven into extinction by Europeans in the 17th century seeking new territories as colonial properties. \n\nIn 1962, Congress expanded the boundary of Virgin Islands National Park to include 5,650 acres of submerged lands to protect and preserve the beautiful coral gardens and seascapes. Today, the Park conducts research, and has developed policies and practices aimed at protecting the fragile coral reef systems. \n\nA Presidential Proclamation established the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/nps.gov\/vicr\/index.htm Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument"]}]}," in January 1999 to protect reefs from further degradation.
