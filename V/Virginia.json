It is known as the \"Mother of States\" as its original territory included West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and Tennessee.  It is also known as the \"Mother of Presidents,\" as eight U.S. presidents were born in the state: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Woodrow Wilson.\n\nWhat is known today as Virginia has been inhabited for many hundreds of years by people of European descent.  Jamestown, Virginia (near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Williamsburg"]]},") is the site of the first lasting British settlement in the New World, dating to 1607.  Native American tribes from Virginia, such as the Powhatan, had some of the richest native cultures in the Colonies.\n\nIn colonial times, Virginia was settled mainly along the rivers that empty into the Chesapeake bay.  The settlers relied on slave labor to grow cash crops, such as tobacco, and relied on trade from England for basic needs.  While settlers primarily from England, Scotland, and Ireland settled along the Potomac, Rappahannock, and James Rivers, many German settlers migrated into Virginia from Pennsylvania along the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nVirginia seceded from the Union in 1861 and has a strong Civil War heritage, as well as a strong sense of Southern pride and feeling of independence that exists in much of the state (especially the capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Richmond (Virginia)"],["Richmond"]]},") even today.\n\nFollowing the Reconstruction after the Civil War, Virginia's economy shifted toward growing food crops in the north of the state, while the southern interior of the state continued to grow tobacco on smaller farms. The major shipyards at Norfolk continued to grow in importance as a major coal port and a naval base.  \n\nFollowing the growth of the US Federal Government during and after World War II, Northern Virginia grew at an astronomical pace as government workers and contractors settled across the Potomac River from Washington, DC.  Today, Virginia's economy is dominated by military bases dotted all over the state, government contracting agencies, and residents who commute into Washington, DC.  Virginia Beach serves as a popular summer vacation spot and the Appalachian Mountains offer outdoor recreation.  Virginia is also a popular destination for history buffs as Virginia was a major player in much of America's history.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nEnglish is spoken by most residents. In rural areas and farther south, you may experience what is commonly known as “Southern accent”. This accent generally does not stop fluent English speakers from understanding the person, but non-native English speakers may experience problems. Most people can deliberately speak in non-accented English upon request but find it difficult to do so for extended length of time. As with all places, locals may have nonstandard words to refer to places, actions and people. Locals are understanding of tourists who do not know these words and will clarify upon request.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nVirginia like all states in United States can be entered freely by people who are either American Citizens or by other people who have been allowed entry into United States.

Northern Virginia (the Washington DC suburbs) is serviced by Washington Dulles International Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (or, simply \"National\", \"Washington National\", \"Reagan\" for short).  Washington National airport is a better airport for access to Washington DC due to its proximity to the Washington Metro Rail system and lower volume.  Washington-Dulles Airport is better for international flights and access to the rest of the Northern Virginia area as it is outside the majority of the traffic patterns that plague locations closer to DC.  However, its shuttles which transport passengers between the concourses, called \"Mobile Lounges,\" make moving through certain portions of Dulles Airport an inconvenience.  Most concourses are now connected to the main concourse via moving walkways and an internal rail system.\n\nFor Central and Southern Virginia destinations, Richmond International Airport offers flights to and from many major cities East of the Mississippi and in Texas.  \n\nFor Eastern Virginia, especially the Virginia Beach\/Norfolk\/Hampton Roads\/Portsmouth area, Norfolk International Airport offers flights to and from cities all over the U.S.\n\nOther smaller regional airports service Roanoke, Lynchburg, Charlottesville, and Harrisonburg.
