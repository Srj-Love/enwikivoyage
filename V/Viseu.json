[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cm-viseu.pt\/ Viseu"]}]},", is a charming hilltop city and district capital (around 53,000 inhabitants) in central ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portugal"]]},". It is situated in the Beira Alta between the mountain ranges of the Serra da Estrela and Serra do Caramulo, about halfway between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aveiro"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guarda"]]}," off the new A25 Motorway right in the middle of the famous Dao wine region. \n\nThe city, a regional center for agriculture and education, has many schools, a modern polytechnic and 2 universities (the Catholic University and the Piaget Institute). There is no heavy industry.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nViseu has excellent motorway links with other major cities, the coast and Spain via the junction of the A25 (east\/west) and A24\/IP3 (north\/south) motorways. There is an outer ringroad consisting of part A25 and IP5.\n\nPorto airport is the nearest international airport, about 1 3\/4 hours away by car.\n\nViseu has its own municipal airport for light private aircraft.\n\nThere are frequent long distance coach services operated by Rede\/Expressos to other major cities.\n\nThere is no train service. The closest railway stations are in Nelas or Mangualde, both on the Linha da Beira Alta. This makes Viseu the largest city on the Iberian peninsula without a railway station.\n\nVisit:",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cidadeviseu.com Portal Cidade Viseu"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nBy car: sign-posting for the city centre is good. There is an inner ring road with 12 roundabouts giving access to the inner city at frequent intervals.\n\nThe old town itself can easily be explored on foot. There is also a recently (2009) installed funicular connecting the lower city (The Forum) with the upper city (Adro da Se).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe well-kept, clean and prosperous city has a fine historic quarter (Centro Historico) with cobbled streets, hidden alleys, flights of steps and intriguing corners. There are numerous Renaissance and Baroque mansions and palaces as well as some remaining city gates like the 15th C. Porta do Soar de Cima. The crowning glory is the Romanesque and Gothic Sé (Cathedral), one of the finest in Portugal and partly built directly on granite boulders which is particularly evident at the back. It is located on the Adro da Sé, an impressive square, which is also the location of the striking Misericordia Church with its broad white Rococo facade. Since it is the highest point in town, the square provides extensive views to the surrounding countryside.\n\nHowever, striking modern architecture is evident too. The Forum shopping, food and cinema centre (2005), bordering the river Pavia, is a good example as is the enormous Palacio do Gelo shopping & restaurant mall (2008) with its indoor ice rink and other sports facilities, easily accessible on the ring road. Also of note is the converted Old Market on the Rua Formosa with cafés and boutiques, and now a venue for exhibitions and open air concerts. The city has ample municipal facilities for visitors such as free internet locations, a modern public library, a new large district hospital, a youth hostel (Pousada de Juventude), a brand new swimming pool complex and other modern sports facilities.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Old Quarter (Centro Historico) with Rua Direita, Rua Augusta Hilario, Rua D.
