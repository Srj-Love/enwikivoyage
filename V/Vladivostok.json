The main terminal (domestic) recently underwent a major renovation, making it the most modern airport building in the Russian Far East. The international terminal, which is located just next door to the domestic one (in fact, they share the same parking), is very small and usually crowded, but as Vladivostok is slated to receive the APEC summit in 2012, the new terminal is beginning to get flights.\n\nCurrently, the main connection from the airport to the city is via local and shuttle buses (running to the Vladivostok bus station) but don't count on them if your flight arrives late in the day. If your flight arrives late, you could take your chance with a metered taxi, or negotiate with an informal \"taxi\" - starting price is a ridiculous 2500 Rubles - pay no more than 1000. The train station, finally connecting the airport to the rail network, is finally completed in the new terminal, and the link is operated under the ",{"type":"''","value":["Aeroexpress"]}," brand. One-way ticket to-and-from the airport costs 200 Rubles, and those wanting to splurge may dish out 700 R for a \"business class\" ride. Note that this train also doubles as a limited local train and thus includes several commuter cars (with a typical commuter amenities and sharply reduced fare around 70 R), and makes a couple of additional stops along the way.\n\nThe airport's anchor airline is ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.vladivostokavia.ru\/en\/index.html Vladivostok Air"]},", recently merged into Aeroflot, that serves a majority of its available domestic and international routes. It's the largest airline in the Russian Far East; it operates relatively modern fleet which primarily includes Airbus A320 and Tupolev Tu 204-300 types of aircraft and offers something like European short-haul type of service on all flights.\n\nIn late 2013 Vladivostok Air ceased to be an Aeroflot's independent subsidiary and was merged with another Far Eastern company, Sakhalin Air Routes (SAT), into the new airline named Aurora. A lot of the two parent airlines destinations were closed, yet for reopen just for now, and some critics say that it was the move by the Aeroflot proper to \"steal\" the more lucrative destinations, such as those in Korea and Japan, from its subsidiaries. On the other hand, assuming that the crotics are right the aerial juggernaut seems to be slow in exploiting this trick, with the niche covered only by flights codeshared with S7 and other airlines.\n\nThe busiest destination is Moscow. On average, there are 3-5 flights per day. Flights are much more frequent in summertime (June - September) due to heavy passenger traffic. It is recommended to book an itinerary at least one month in advance during that season in order to get a reasonable fare. Principal carriers to operate this route are  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aeroflot.com Aeroflot Russian Airlines"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.transaero.ru\/en\/index.html Transaero"]},", and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.s7.ru\/en\/index.html S7 Airlines"]},".\n\nOther destinations are mostly served daily, and often the service is even less frequent. Besides ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},", domestic destinations include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Novosibirsk"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yekaterinburg"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Irkutsk"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khabarovsk"]]}," and many others.

",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.koreanair.com Korean Air"]}," operates Incheon route 5 times a week (in 2009) and offers flights from the continental U.S. via a connection in Seoul-Incheon. Completion of the new international terminal in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haneda"]]}," airport and subsequent increase in its capacity may lead to the opening of a direct scheduled flight by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["ANA"]]}," to Tokyo (previously only served by Vladivostok Air charters and then scheduled flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Narita"]]},"). From 2 Nov, 2012, S7 Airlines opened direct flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," and Tokyo.\n\nUnfortunately, due to scarcity of the airlines operating from the airport a lot of destinations are monopolized and tickets are offered at exorbitant fares. For example, realizing its almost monopolistic position to offer connections, Korean Air bargains a fare starting from US$800 for 1.5 hours plane ride to Seoul. Vladivostok Air asked similarly extortionate prices for tickets to its Japanese destinations for the same 1.5 hours ride. The only real competitive destination is Moscow where a lot of airlines compete with each other, and sometimes really hot deals can be found. There are some hopes that aforementioned openings of a ferry line and additional flights may lead to increased competition and falling prices, and indeed there is ",{"type":"''","value":["some"]}," progress, but it is rather slow and leaves much to see in the future.\n\nAs of July 2011, most of the 50+ kilometre road to the city is disrupted by roadworks - rather than repairing in sections, they have chosen to dig it all up at once. Expect delays - buses take 90-120 minutes, taxis at least 1 hour. By the August 2012, though, all major roadworks are finished, and the new, additional road with the scenic bridge over the Amur bay is finally completed, so the problem has largely disappeared.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are a number of local bus routes from most suburban locations and nearby towns as well. Most places around the region are linked to Vladivostok by bus.

The easiest way from north eastern China is to take the direct bus from Harbin, to where there are good train connections to\/from Beijing.\n\nIt takes about five hours to get to the city from the Chinese border, and the road goes through one of the most picturesque areas of the Russian Far East.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Vladstatue.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Memorial to the Fighters for the Soviet Power in the Far East, in Vladivostok"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By public transport"]},"\nVladivostok has a wide range of transportation, from streetcars to funicular railway. The trams and trolleybuses have, unfortunately, mostly gone in an effort to improve traffic — it hasn't worked, though, mainly because at least two lanes on most downtown streets are still taken for unregulated parking. However there are talks of reinstating at least some trolleybus routes, and lengthening the network to include some suburban destinations. For tram, on the other hand, while the mayor pays some lip service to it, his actions prove otherwise.\n\nBy far the most common is the bus, both large route buses (mainly used Korean ones, some could be seen still carrying Seoul or Busan route plaques) and ",{"type":"''","value":["marshrutka"]}," shared taxis (which generally follow bus routes). Buses are extremely crowded but frequent; the fares are flat 17 r. ($0.50) for the downtown routes, but go up to 120 r. ($4.0) for suburban ones. Hop on bus in the back and then pay the driver as you exit from the front.  Many buses leave from outside the \"Clever House\" (Cløver House) Department store.\n\nAbout half of the buses are equipped to receive payments by a refillable ",{"type":"''","value":["Dolphin"]}," smart card that can be bought and refilled in the automated kiosks at most major stops. Push the card to the terminal near the driver for a couple of seconds, until it gives two beeps, and you are set. Because the cards and kiosks are issued by a major local bank, the card also could be used as a normal debit card in some selected shops, and in the kiosks you could pay your mobile phone, etc.\n\nOn the down note, the bus companies are constantly criticized for neglecting the state of their fleets, running the buses well past their service lives, unduly economizing on cleaning and personnel (they tend to hire recent immigrants, who can be paid as little as possible), and creating the competition for the passengers' fare among the drivers, which leads to long delays on stops and reckless driving.\n\nThe city has recently stepped in by reinstating the municipal bus company with newer buses and better controlled drivers. All municipal buses are equipped with electronic payment system and trackers, as the city also pushes to equip all the buses with the tracking hardware. The positions and waiting time for the equipped buses could be seen at the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bus125.ru Bus 125"]}," website, and major stops are gradually being equipped with electronic timetables.\n\nAccess to the outlying areas is generally best done by bus or suburban commuter train elektrichka.
