It is wonderfully peaceful and natural, as it is ",{"type":"'''","value":["car-free"]},", except for a few permitted vehicles of locals.\n\nThe island measures 4.052 hectare, of which the largest part is a desert-like area in the west, the Vliehors. There is one village on the island, Oost-Vlieland. On the empty plain on the west used to be another village, West-Vlieland, but it was taken by the sea in 1736. The plain is now used for military exercises. The island has a population of approximately 1100 people and is well known for the beautiful landscape, the large and various bird population and the peacefulness. In summer, many tourists come to visit the island.\n\nVlieland was divided from the mainland of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Friesland"]]}," in a flood in 1287, which formed the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Waddenzee"]]},". It used to count two villages, West- and Oost-Vlieland, but the former was evacuated after repeatedly being flooded.\n\nVlieland is an island of dunes. It has the North Sea to the north and the Waddenzee to the south. The north coast has beautiful, peaceful beaches.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nTo get into Vlieland, you'll have to take the ferry from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harlingen (Netherlands)"],["Harlingen"]]},".

Both are operated by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rederij-doeksen.nl\/ rederij Doeksen"]},", which has times and prices are available on their website. Usually, there are at least 3 daily regular ferries and an additional 1 to 3 fast ferries, but always check shortly before as the schedule can change subject to season, weather and number of passengers. A one way ticket (adult) will cost around €25, with an additional €7 for the fast service. Vlieland is in principle car-free, so although the ferries can transport cars (from €140 single trip), usually only residents will get the special permit.\n\nThere is a train to Harlingen Harbour from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leeuwarden"]]},", and also by car, this is easy to reach: see the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harlingen (Netherlands)"],["Harlingen"]]}," article for details.\nPeople planning a return tour by train from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leeuwarden"]]}," can opt to buy a \"Waddenretour\" (€28,00 in 2011) ticket that is inclusive of the train ticket (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leeuwarden"]]}," - Harlingen Haven trajectory) and the ferry ticket.
