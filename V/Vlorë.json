It is 135km from the capital city, Tirana, separated by only 72km from Italy (Channel of Otranto) and 123km from Greece (the island of Corfu).\nThe surface area of Vlore is 1609km2 and includes 4 cities; Vlore, Selenica, Himara and Orikum. \nIt has a climate typical of Mediterranean Sea, with mild winters that are generally wet, and summers that are dry. \nThe Vlore region has three basic climatic zones:\nThe coast has moderate temperatures, as the other countries of the Mediterranean, and does not suffer the cold winds like the western side of Albania.\n\nThe inland, hilly areas in the region have a cool climate with rains and similar to that of Central Europe with a relatively mild climate.\nThe mountainous region, such as Llogara, possesses a dry continental climate. In winter it can be quite cold (though snow is relatively uncommon) and has fresh, cool air all summer long.\nVlore receives more hours of sunshine per year than any other region of Albania - averaging over 2000 \"sunny\" hours annually. \nVlore has the only peninsula in Albania, which is named Karaburun. It is roughly 16km by 4km in size, and an area of 62km². The peninsula of Karaburun is rich in natural resources (famous for marble), woodlands, and archeological remains. It is also home to a reserve for wild pigs.\nThe only island in Albania, named Sazan, is located 17km from the port of Vlore and 9km from Triport (Three Gates) in the Vlore region. The highest point of the island is 342m. Sazan has a surface area of 5.7km² and 12km of coast. A rocky cliff breaks the beach.\nVlore, long known for its olive production, at last count had approximately 280,000 olive trees. The olive trademark \" Vlonjak\" is one of the oldest in Europe and is known for its great oil production.\nThe territory around Vlore comes from thriving ancient cities such as Amantia-Ploce, Olympe-Mavrova, Orikos-Orikum, Himera-Himare, Kionina-Kanine, Nymfeum-Selenica and Aulona-Vlora.\n\nA lot of famous people in Albania were born in Vlore, including 6 former ministers (Xhafaj, Malaj, Angjeli, Gjinushi, Leskaj, Pango), a lot of famous singers (including Aurela Gace and Poni), and several other VIPs.\nVlore is also known for being the head city for the 1997 revolution in Albania. Zani Caushi was one of the local leaders, although he later started to trade drugs. If possible, do not get in a discussion about 1997 while being in Vlore.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe dialect of Vlore is difficult to learn, as it includes a special kind of speaking (slower than the rest of Albania), difficult \"r\" and \"l\" (\"r\", especially when the first letter of a word, is severe, while \"l\" is something between \"l\" and \"ll\", similar to the Greek \"l\") and a lot of special phrases. Vlore people almost always use \"motra\" and \"vlla\" (sister and brother) when addressing at each other, even if its the first time you meet with them.
