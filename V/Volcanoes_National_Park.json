You will need to register yourself (or your driver \/ guide may complete this on your behalf). There is tea and coffee served in the main shelter and some days there is a dance presentation given by the local cultural center (this typically starts around 6:45 am). The park guides will place individuals into trekking groups based on ability and your preference for which group to visit. This process takes 30-40 minutes during which you can walk around the grounds or relax in the main shelter. After the assignments are made your driver \/ guide will direct you to a location on the lawn where your trekking  group will assemble. Once all members are assembled the park guide will go over some basic information and have you fill out a form with your name, nationality, etc. The form has a location for passport number and permit number but these are not required (the form is for information gathering only). The park guide will give you an introduction to the group you will be visiting along with showing you a diagram of the gorilla group's family tree. Once this initial introduction is complete (10-15 minutes) you will find your driver and proceed to the starting point for your trek. \n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" The Trek "]},"\nYour driver will take you to the starting point of the trek (there are multiple entry points into the park) which can be a trip of 20-45 minutes sometimes on very poor roads. Once you have reached the entry point parking lot your trekking group will reassemble with your park guide and secondary guide. Additional instructions will be given and you will be offered a walking stick for the trek. In addition, this is when you can hire a porter. The porters are all wearing the same blue coveralls and there is a defined order in which porters are selected. Ask your driver or the park guide if you want to hire a porter and they will signal to a porter to give you a hand. It is recommended you use a porter if you have any bags or other equipment as the hike can be long, steep or through difficult terrain. Also, it is an important way to support the local economy and help incentivise anti-poaching efforts. You will pay\/tip the porter at the end of the trek.\n\nYour starting position will be outside the park and depending on the starting position you may have to hike up to an hour to actually get to the park boundary which is marked with a stone wall. The area before the park is typically made up of farming fields. \n\nOnce you reach the park boundary additional instructions will be given about how to behave around the primates such as restrictions on eating, drinking, smoking and bathroom breaks. \n\nThe trek inside the park boundary varies depending on the location of your group and may include steep climbs, movement through a bamboo forest or hacking through thick brush.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Viewing the Primates "]},"\nYou will know you have reached the staging area when additional park trackers join your group. At this point you will need to leave all bags and walking sticks with the porters but will be allowed to take cameras with you.

After the one hour visit you return to the staging area where you left your belongings and prepare to hike out to the starting point.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Return "]},"\nUpon your return to the starting point you will pay your porters (consider giving tip) and can also tip the guides.\n\nFinally, you can return to the park headquarters where you will be given a certificate indicating that you have completed a visit with your specific gorilla group.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Equipment "]},"\nTrekking through the Virunga forests of Rwanda requires some basic equipment to ensure you can transport sufficient liquids, protect yourself from the flora and fauna and can safely navigate the terrain.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Required \/ Highly Recommended"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Day pack or other wearable bag to carry water, snacks and camera"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Long sleeve shirt"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Long pants"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Sturdy hiking shoes or boots (preferably waterproof)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Bug repellent with DEET"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Socks that can allow you to tuck your pants into them or hiking gaters (to protect from red ants)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" At least 1 - 2 liters of water"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Optional"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Utility gloves"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Walking stick (one will be provided to you by the park guide)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Wide brimmed hat"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Sunglasses (with optional neck strap)"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kinigi Cultural Center"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gorilla Trekking"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Golden Monkey Trekking"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hike to Dian Fossey Grave"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hike to Volcano Creator Lake"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Rwanda"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Volcanoes National Park"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-1.4833333333333"],["29.533333333333"]]}]
