It's a fishermen's village, and the bustling harbour area with the many boats are still a major attraction today. From the 1880s it was a popular dwelling place for artists, who found that the town seemed hardly touched by time and captured its characteristics in lots of different paintings and other works of art. Volendam's traditional costume is one of best known examples of ancient clothing in the country. Only a handful of people wear it in their daily lives today, but as the locals have recognized its value for tourism you will probably still run into it here or there.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Volendam is famous for its singers. There's an extensive Dutch music scene here and several of the most popular Dutch singers originate from this village. This music is known as the ",{"type":"''","value":["palingsound"]},", literally \"eel sound\", a reference to the village's heritage as a fishing village. In the 1960s, the Cats was a popular group and in the 1970s BZN took over as the new flagship group. In 1995, BZN performed a duet with the ten year old Jan Smit, who quickly became a celebrity in his own right and is now the leading singer of the village. You can find posters and merchandise of him across town.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=VVV tourist information office Volendam"],["url=http:\/\/www.vvv-volendam.nl"],["email="],["address=Zeestraat 37"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+31 299 - 36 37 47"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The tourist information office is very helpful.
