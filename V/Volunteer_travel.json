These meaningful experiences allow individuals the chance to give back to the international community, whether this be teaching in underprivileged schools, working with animals in Africa, or helping with community development project.

Any money donated goes not to education, but to enriching the owners of the institution - which most often will not allow the \"orphans\" to leave. The usual caveats about the use of children for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["begging"]]}," apply. Employing \"voluntourism\" to provide workers to these institutions is also problematic due to frequent departure of travellers (to be replace by new tourists) creating a very unstable home environment for the child.\n\nCareful research is needed to verify the effort meets the needs of the local community, instead of merely what might sound good to prospective donors. Importing travellers as free labour to \"rebuild a community\", if the community already has many unemployed builders who cannot find work, is an expensive but unhelpful proposition; likewise, proposing to \"build a school\" in a community which already has a suitable building but cannot afford salaries to hire instructors sounds great but accomplishes little.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Work"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinetopic"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Volunteer travel"]]}]
