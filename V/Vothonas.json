A tangle of paths lead from the village up to the houses that are build into the cliffs.  Much as the villagers did in Caldera, the residents built their homes in the rocky walls of the ravine.  An interesting place to see while here is the church of St. Ann which was built in 1827 and is the oldest in the village.  The wooden screen it has is decorated with pictures from the Old Testament.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Santorini"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
