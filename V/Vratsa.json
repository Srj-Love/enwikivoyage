The train frequency is acceptable. An express first-class-only train runs once a day from Plovdiv (via Sofia) and back.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThe omnibus station is located near the railway station. Busses connect Vratza directly with Sofia, Vidin, Kozloduy, Lom, Oriahovo, and many other cities. Nearby villages are also connected via bus links. The bus frequency to and from Sofia is very good, from early morning to the late afternoon. In summer, there are also bus lines to some Black Sea resorts. There are also busses to Spain and Portugal, but not as often as the inter-Bulgaria connections.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nVratsa is situated on the international E-79 route, and thus easily accessed from Vidin (2 hours), Sofia (1.5-2 hours), etc. Road signs are mostly written in both cyrillic and latin.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nThere is no regional or international airport in Vratsa.

Note that cycling on the road can be dangerous, since not all car drivers keep distance and tolerate bikers. Cycling through the main street in the rush hour or in the weekend can be quite challenging when trying to avoid crashes with the huge amount of pedestrians. Mind that some pedestrian areas are forbidden for bikers!\n\nThere is a ski and bike rental shop on Ul. Polk Buyukliyski (2 Lev \/ hour).  Ring the buzzer if he is not there, someone upstairs might help you or at least say something out the window.  He is often not there, so maybe not a good idea to rent here if you need your passport back by a certain time.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nThe yellow cabs can be spotted very often and are rather cheap.

Make sure you have warm clothes and watertight shoes, since the temperatures in the cave are rather low. There was a local bus line servicing the area around the cave, but a better option is to organize your own transportation (rent-a-car or bikes).  As of October 2010, there is no bus line going to Ledenika Cave; everyone in town says taxi was the only way.  It takes about 2 hours to bike to the cave, with the majority of the time spent on the climb between the two forks (head right at both, at kilometers 2 and 12).  Save a little energy as the last 2-3 kilometers to the cave are a steep downhill, which you have to climb back up after the tour.  There also appeared to be a chair lift heading in the direction of the cave from the first fork—it is not possible to see where it ended especially in the foggy days, but it isn't currently running anyway. Your mountain trip can be extended over two or more days: there is a small budget hotel near the Ledenika Cave. A pre-booking is useful."]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Vratsa"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["43.2000"],["23.5500"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["North Bulgaria"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Vratsa"]]}]
