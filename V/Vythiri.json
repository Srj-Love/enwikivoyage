It is believed that his \"spirit\" is being chained to the tree. Most of the driver pray and do offerings as they pass by the tree to make their trip accident free.  Another story goes, that when the British first came to Wayanad the locals helped them and it was the Adivasi Mahouts who took them to the top the mountains.  As the Portuguese were close behind them, they did not want the Mahouts to go back and get the Portuguese.  Hence they killed the Mahout and soon after that, there were many accidents in the area and the Mahout's spirit was believed to be the reason.  A local priest contained the spirit to a tree and hung a chain over it so that the spirit would not escape.
