For example Engelsbergs Bruk, built in 1681, is since 1993 on the UNESCO's world heritage list. It is the only one in Sweden still intact, in machinery and buildings. Today the industrial heritage has put Västmanland in the front row regarding technical knowledge. \n\nThe county is a mix of nature, with interesting and lovely environments. In the south is Lake Mälarens wide and beautiful landscape which hosts a variety of birds and flowers. In the north you can find the hilly mountains, the valleys and the deep forests. The county is between the Swedish lowland and the hilly country of the north.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Talk "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Itineraries "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Do "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Eat "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Drink "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Stay safe "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Go next "]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["59.7500"],["16.3333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Svealand"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Västmanland"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Sweden\/Västmanland_County\/"]]}]
