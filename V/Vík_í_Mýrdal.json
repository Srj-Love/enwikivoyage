Its importance comes largely from the fact that it's about half way along the south coast, and its one of the few villages actually on the sandy beach that makes up most of the south coast. The area is dominated by Mýrdalsjökull, the glacier which is home to Katla, one of Iceland's fiercest volcanoes. The village and the surrounding countryside are in constant danger of floods which would result from a potential eruption, which has been expected for many years now. On the other side, the Atlantic ocean is treacherous in these parts, waves can be big and small boats easily get swallowed up if the crews don't know what they're doing. While there is no reason to worry about the volcano if you're a tourist, you should be very careful by the sea - tourists have drowned when caught by waves on the beach near Vík.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nVík lies on the Ring Road, in an area where there are very few other roads. It's a little under 200 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reykjavík"]]}," in the west, and about 270 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Höfn"]]}," in the east. \n\nThe bus that travels along the south coast stops in Vík.
