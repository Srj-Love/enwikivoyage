The only permanent inhabitants are several thousand Bedouin nomads and villagers. There is no real infrastructure, leaving the area quite unspoilt. Apart from the Bedouin goat hair tents, the only structures are a few concrete shops and houses and the fort headquarters of the Desert Patrol Corps.\n\nT E Lawrence (of Arabia) spent a significant amount of time here during the course of the British-inspired Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire during the First World War (1914-1918). Fans of the 1962 film ",{"type":"''","value":["Lawrence of Arabia"]}," will be familiar with the landscape, which is not so much sand dunes as it is a mass of soaring cliffs and sandstone and granite mountains (",{"type":"''","value":["jebel"]}," in Arabic).  \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:WadiRumRocks.jpg"],["thumb"],["rocks"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:WadiRumNorth.jpg"],["thumb"],["Wadi Rum seen from Desert Highway"]]},"\nWadi Rum is a short detour from the Desert Highway between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amman"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aqaba"]]},". A side road leads to the entrance where you will find the Wadi Rum Visitors Centre, a police office and a lot of potential guides offering camel and 4x4 treks. The cost to enter the Wadi Rum Protected Area is ",{"type":"<","value":["abbr",{"title":"Jordanian dinar"},["JOD"]]},"5 per person as of Feb 2014.\n\nMost buses that travel the highway between Aqaba and Petra should be able to drop you at the intersection to Wadi Rum (Not the buses from Jett company). Once at the intersection, you can hitch hike (common in this part of Jordan, no problem for women alone even) or take another minibus (JOD1-2, they seem to turn up quite regularly) to the Visitor's Centre where you can meet your guide. This final leg of the trip shouldn't cost more than JOD5 per person. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["From Aqaba"]},"\nIf you plan to get there by bus, it is incredibly useful to have this image in your head: there is a highway which runs from Aqaba all the way to Amman. There is a well-marked turnoff (let's call this the Wadi Rum Turnoff) on this highway to Wadi Rum, about 40 km out of Aqaba. The Wadi Rum Visitor's Centre is about 20-30 km down the road from this turn off, and the Wadi Rum Village is just beyond it. \n\nBuses depart from various places in Aqaba. The JETT and Trust buses depart from their own stations, but basically all the other buses (",{"type":"'''","value":["including the mentioned minibuses"]},") depart from the main Aqaba bus station. Note that even though JETT buses travel right by the Wadi Rum turn off, they are not allowed to stop and let you off - this means that if you want to get to Wadi Rum by bus, the bus station is the place to be.\n\nThere is usually at least one direct bus from Aqaba to the Wadi Rum Visitor's Centre and the Wadi Rum Village per day. Be careful though if you plan to go to Wadi Rum on a Friday - it is very possible that these buses are not running (you should ideally go to the Bus Station and ask the drivers the day before). These buses:\n1) leave 2-3 times per day during the high season (Spring and Autumn). The last regular bus leaves at 13:00 (or possibly 15:00, according to ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.your-guide-to-aqaba-jordan.com\/get_to_wadi_rum.html this"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wadirum.org\/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=11&Itemid=41 this"]},", but don't count on it). \n2) leave once per day during the low season (summer and winter). There is a daily minibus from Wadi Rum Village to Aqaba that leaves at 06:30 (or 07:30 - as of 2011 there is some disagreement), and this returns to Wadi Rum when it is full or the driver feels like it. The minibus journey should cost around JOD3 per person. \n\nYou can also get to Wadi Rum by catching any bus\/minibus (JOD3-4) from the Aqaba bus station headed to Amman, Ma'an, or Petra and get off at the Wadi Rum Turnoff mentioned above. These run to Amman every hour from 7am-3pm, but another company (Afana) operates them until 10pm, perhaps at a slightly higher cost, however. You should then be able to hitch a ride quite easily down the 20-30km road to the Visitor's Centre or the Village for JOD2-3.\n\nA private taxi from Aqaba will cost you JOD15-25 depending on where you are in the city (though JOD25 is the price almost universally quote to tourists, and you may be hard-pressed to get most of them down even to JOD20), and will take you to the Visitor's Centre where your guide will meet you if you have arranged one, or where you may find a guide. If you decide to make round trip you can arrange with taxi driver to wait for you at Visitor's Centre for 3-4 hours and take back. It will cost 40JD. Taxi drivers usually suggest to take you there at 1pm and take back after sunset. Taxis from the Israeli border will probably cost JOD20-25.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["From Petra"]},"\nThere is currently one bus per day from Wadi Musa (Petra) that leaves at 06:30 and costs JOD5.  The trip generally takes 1.5 hours and tickets should be booked through your hotel at Petra, it will then collect you from your hotel directly in the morning.  The bus stops at the Visitor's Centre and Rum Village and returns to Wadi Musa for visitors travelling on to Petra (departure at 8 or 9am).\n\nTaxis to and from Petra cost JOD25-30.\n\nAgain you also have the option of taking any bus heading to Aqaba and asking to be dropped at the Wadi Rum Intersection (see above).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["From Amman"]},"\nNo bus goes directly to\/from Amman, but regular buses head towards Aqaba or Ma'an.  Again, you can get off at the Wadi Rum Intersection (see above). Expect to pay not more than JOD12.  Service taxis will also stop here for you and are generally quicker than the buses, although be aware that this is not a private taxi, so it will pick up other passengers and make detours as the other passengers require. Service taxis should cost JOD15-25 per person.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nPrivate vehicles are prohibited past of the village of Wadi Rum.  If you want to experience the grandeur that the Wadi has to offer, you will need to hire a guided camel or 4-wheel-drive tour.  The costs may vary based on the guide, the length of the trip, and your willingness and ability to bargain. You'd get the best price by contacting the local Bedouin directly. The usual price is JOD50-75 per jeep for 3-5hour tour or JOD20 per camel\/hour (November 2011). \n       \nA tour including a taxi ride from Petra, 4 hours in Wadi Rum, not including the JOD5\/person entrance fee, and a taxi ride to the Israeli border cost JOD130 (April 2011). Not cheap. Avoid the scammers in Petra who try to take you for a tour in the desert north to Wadi Rum for JOD80.
