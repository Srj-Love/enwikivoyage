Porters -- blue coats for the Indians, green coats for the Pakistanis -- can carry your belongings for a few dollars.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:International border at Wagah - evening flag lowering ceremony.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["The evening flag lowering ceremony"]]},"\nThere is daily flag raising and lowering ceremony at Wagah Border, which is done with pomp and ceremony. It involves some of the tallest members  of the Indian Border Force and the Pakistani Rangers marching and closing the many gates. It has become a tradition for people from both sides of the border gather and see this. Both sides synchronise their parade and the entire event is meant to create a feel-good\/patriotic fervour amongst the crowd. It is called the beating retreat ceremony. Since 2010, the Wagha ceremony has begun to tone down so one might see less of the flourishing of Peacock helmets and goose-stepping.\n\nAs of Jan 2009, the flag lowering ceremony which happens around 4:15 PM everyday has become the main event for tourists. In addition, there is now a short cultural programme also done by local folk dancers (Bhangra) for the waiting crowd before the flag lowering. Please take note that a peak crowd of up to 2000+ people can assemble on the Indian side and up and over 1000 people on the Pakistani on sides weekends\/long weekends\/public holidays. The crowd consists of both tourists & locals. The noise and atmosphere of the assembled crowds on both sides of the border is similar to that of a sporting match and very entertaining.\n\nThe border gates have a visitor gallery on each side, basically concrete steps created around the border main road. This allows most people in the crowd to get a seat but it is not uncommon to see up to 500-1000 people standing at the periphery. There are metal fences to help direct and control the crowds in and out of the seating areas. \n\nIdeally, one should reach the border gates by 3:30 PM to get seating if you're going on a rush day.\n\nThe seating area is as follows:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" VIP seating - closest to the gates and requires a special pass which can be made from the BSF station near the Amristsar bypass road a couple of days in advance."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Ladies exclusive - this is new, a section where only ladies, small children are allowed.

Occasional pushing\/jostling may happen."]},"\nCellphones, Cameras (any kind), men's wallets are allowed. No covered bags (including ladies purses & handbags) are allowed inside the visitor areas. However, border personnel allow carrying of clear plastic bags with few snacks, water, children's food etc. The restrictions are usually dependent on the crowd and perceived security alertness on that day.\n\nFor tourists coming in to see the ceremony, note that the taxis\/cars need to be parked about 500m away from the entry gates to the border area. You will need to walk in and reach the visitor gallery. Stay to the left side until you reach the grandstands.\n\nDo not bring any bags! Bags of all sizes are not allowed in and there are no cloaking facilities. Cameras are ok, but leave the camera bag at home. \n\nBe prepared for minor traffic jams when the ceremony has finished as up to 200-300 vehicles try and exit around the same time. The main road to Wagah is being widened to a 4 lane one, and should be ready by Jun 09.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" There are no tickets to see this event, it is free for viewing for anyone on the Indian side as of Jan 09."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" As of Mar, 2011 the border apparently closes at 3:30.
