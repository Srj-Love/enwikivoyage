Because of its famous agricultural university, it is more lively than one would expect from a Dutch town with 36,000 inhabitants. In 2007 it had residents from 152 different countries, mainly being students at the university. Wageningen was the site of the formal surrender of the Germans to the Allies in the Netherlands on May 5, 1945, a day that is a public holiday in the Netherlands. Wageningen hosts a military veterans parade and this is followed by great alcohol consumption in the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nWageningen lies close to the right bank of the branch of the Rhine estuary known in the Netherlands as the Nederrijn. Excavations date a settlement at this site back to the Stone Age. The hills to the east of the town provided protection for a Bronze Age tribe from flooding of the Rhine and from enemies and the earliest record of the name (in 838AD) is from the same hilly area. The town has had a chequered history, being occupied or destroyed on several occasions. Also, in 1421 the Rhine changed course, moving further south and, in the process, having a detrimental effect on Wageningen's trade. In the 17th Century the town started tobacco cultivation and there were several cigar manufacturers. The floodplain of the Rhine to the south also had several brick factories, one of which can still be seen.\n\nIn 1876 the Dutch government decided to build the first agricultural school in Wageningen on the grounds that it was in the heart of the country and was surrounded by a wide variety of soils. Since then the town has boomed and Wageningen University is now a world-renowned Life Sciences university. Wageningen also has the largest inland port in the Netherlands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe story goes that Wageningen was given the choice of getting a university or a train station.

For those staying longer it is possible to buy second-hand bikes. A stall in the main square on Saturdays has good bargains. New bikes range from around €200 for a Chinese-made one (looked upon contemptuously by the Dutch) to up to €1000 for a real Dutch bike. All of the main roads have separate cycling lanes. These have their own traffic signals and you are expected to obey them. At roundabouts and other junctions cyclists usually have the right of way but this cannot be guaranteed so be careful. You have to give way if there are white triangles on the track that point towards you.\n\nBus No.88 also takes you around most of Wageningen but it really doesn't make much sense to ride the bus here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Hotel de wereld wageningen.JPG"],["thumb"],["Hotel de Wereld"]]},"\n\nDetailed information in English can be found at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/proefwageningen.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/english.pdf"]},".
