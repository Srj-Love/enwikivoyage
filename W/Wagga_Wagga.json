The city is universally referred to as ",{"type":"''","value":["Wagga"]},".\n\nThe Wagga Wagga Tourist Information Centre, located inside the Wagga Wagga Civic Centre (cnr Baylis and Morrow Streets) provides helpful advice to people visiting the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Discovery"]},"\nThe early colonists first sighted the land in December 1829, which the flourishing City of Wagga Wagga now stands. The persons present at first sighting consisted of Captain Charles Sturt, 39th Regiment, stationed in Sydney, Mr George Macleay and six others. This party passed over the site of future Wagga Wagga on its expedition of discovery down the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers. Settlement swiftly followed.\n\nWagga Wagga was proclaimed a town in 1849 and in the same year surveyor Thomas Townshend marked out the town. In the 1860s the population totalled approximately 700, but by 1881 it had increased to 3,975. In 1879 the railway line was extended south of the river.\n",{"type":"===","value":["The name"]},"\nThe name of the City is derived from the language of the Wiradjuri tribe, which was the biggest aboriginal tribe in New South Wales, embracing the Riverina area.\n\n\"Wagga\" in the local Wiradjuri Aboriginal dialect means \"crow\". The repetition of a word was the method of expressing the plural or emphasis, thus Wagga Wagga means \"crows\" or \"the place where crows assemble in large numbers\". The Murrumbidgee River which runs through the City also derived its name from the aboriginal language and means \"plenty water\" or \"big water\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Regional Express"]}," (REX) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Qantaslink"]}," fly regularly from Sydney and Melbourne domestic airports. Flights start at approximately $79 on special one way, although $120 is about the standard advanced purchase price, with prices rising to several times that if you book close to when you travel. The airport is 15 minutes out of town, both taxis and hire cars are available at the airport. Approximate cost for a taxi to the centre of the city is $30.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Wagga Shuttle Bus"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +61 458350100"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=7 days"],["price="],["content=Services available to and from Wagga Airport, and to and from the Army recruit training ground at Kapooka."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Wagga Wagga Radio Cabs"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +61 131008"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Avis"],["url=http:\/\/www.avis.com\/AvisWeb\/home\/AvisHome?COUNTRY=AU"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +61 136333"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Budget"],["url=http:\/\/www.budget.com.au\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +61 132727"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Hertz"],["url=https:\/\/www.hertz.com.au\/rentacar\/index.jsp?targetPage=reservationOnHomepage.jsp"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +61 133039"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Thrifty"],["url=http:\/\/www.thrifty.com.au\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +61 1300 367 227"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nswtrainlink.info NSW Trainlink"]}]}," offer a daily train service, with the city on the line between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melbourne"]]},", providing two services a day in each direction.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["From Sydney: 7 hours, departing at 6:50AM or 8:40PM.
