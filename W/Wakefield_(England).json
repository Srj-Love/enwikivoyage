In the south east, there are the towns of Hemsworth, South Kirkby and South Elmsall as well as other communities. \n\nSome 70 per cent of the rural communities of the district is designated as green belt. Dotted about the rolling countryside are villages like Middlestown, Crigglestone, Crofton, Woolley and Ackworth.   \n\nWakefield Council and its partner organisations in the Wakefield District Partnership are making great strides in bringing new life to the old mining communities of the south east. Major achievements have already been made in reclaiming former colliery sites for both leisure and industrial use. \n\nWakefield has a lot to offer. It has a rich industrial heritage which visitors can experience at the National Coal Mining museum. It is known for its lively nightlife. The District itself is made up of the City and its Five Town:, Castleford, Horbury, Normanton, Ossett and Pontefract.\n\nAll areas of Wakefield boast some sort of attraction: from Pontefract's castle and sweet factories (including the Haribo factory) to Castleford's Xscape entertainment complex and the Freeport shopping village.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nThere are three airports that are generally seen as accessible from Wakefield,  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.robinhoodairport.com Robin Hood Airport (Doncaster)"]}," ; ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lbia.co.uk Leeds Bradford International Airport"]},"and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester Airport"]]},", which is the best airport for non-European flights.
