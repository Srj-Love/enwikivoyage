The Fort has many architectural features present only to itself, as well as a rich history behind it's cannon batteries. \nMaine was repeatedly involved in northeast border disputes with British Canada, and the area between Castine and the rich lumber city of Bangor was invaded and occupied by the British during the American Revolution and the War of 1812. Despite the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842, Fort Knox was established in 1844 to protect the Penobscot River valley against a possible future British naval incursion. \n\nThe Fort was engineered by famous West Point graduate Isaac Ingalls Stevens, who superintended fortifications on the New England coast from 1841 until 1849. Named for Major General Henry Knox, America’s first Secretary of War, friend of first president George Washington, and a native of Maine. The Fort garrisoned troops from 1863 to 1866, mostly volunteers who were in training before being sent to their active posts, including members of the celebrated 20th Maine, and again in 1898, but never saw military action. \n\nCome explore the Fort and discover this treasure of Maine and United States History. Fort Knox is open May 1 - Nov 1, from 8:30 - sunset. The grounds are open year round for your visiting pleasure. The newly constructed Penobscot Narrows Bridge boasts an observation tower, rising 420’ above sea level, which may only be accessed through the Fort. Set to open this spring the observation tower will provide a breathtaking view of the Penobscot River Valley, and is the only observatory like it in the Western Hemisphere!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Kayak the rocky coast."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Take a schooner sail trip."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Visit nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Camden (Maine)"],["Camden"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Acadia National Park"]]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Visit Lake St. George State Park in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liberty (Maine)"],["Liberty"]]},".
