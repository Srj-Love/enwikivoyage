Her daughter-in-law, Doris Burn, also wrote several books while living on the island. The last store on Waldron closed in 1942 and no regular ferry service has been offered to the island. Since 1976, Waldron has been a 'limited development district'. No large-scale mining of natural resources is allowed. No marinas or breakwaters can be built.

During this survey, one of the San Juan islands was named after one or other of a pair of Waldron brothers, Richard Russell Waldron or Thomas Westbrook Waldron.\n\nIn the nineteenth century Waldron Island sandstone was mined for use in various buildings. Coal deposits were also discovered on Waldron Island.

Waldron Island's nature preserve is an excellent place to start a beach combing adventure offering 1000's of feet of public shoreline which is mostly rocky offering and offering excellent tide pools. Small crabs, moon snails, sea stars and sand dollars are common sites and tide pools can offer hours of exploration.\n\nBe warned that sea shells and driftwood are considered part of the natural environment and should not be removed, however the often rocky and wild shores are havens for creating and revealing beach glass and anything artificial found is fair game for removal.  Be respectful of private property and gentle with sea creatures. Keep a wide distance away from nesting birds, seals and other shore animals and always put back anything removed from the shoreline.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Birdwatching"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus -Skagit valley-8b.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["Bald Eagle are common site in the San Juan Islands"]]},"\nThe San Juan Islands are in the Pacific coast flyaway which extends from Alaska to South America and almost 300 species of birds have been observed on the islands.

A wide array of crab traps are available from a variety of area sporting goods stores and the red and white buoys marking the traps are a common site on the water during the short crabbing season.
