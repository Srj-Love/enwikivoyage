Most attractions can be seen for free, but some of the locations require admission fees if you want to go in and have a detailed look around.\n\nThis tour can take several hours up to a full day, depending on speed, fitness level, and time spent at each location. It can easily be extended over several days with longer visits to some of the museums, galleries and shopping districts.\n\nThere are some optional loops listed on this tour, which will extend it further.

Use a maximum protection sunblock (SPF 30+) on all exposed skin, and re-apply during the day. Wear a hat with a wide brim. Do not worry about making a fashion statement - Sydneysiders are very sun-aware and won't look twice at anyone in a sunhat. Sunglasses are also highly recommended.\n\nIn winter (remember that Australian winter is from April to September), central Sydney can get quite chilly, especially on a windy day, as the wind is funneled between the tall buildings. Wear a wind-resistant jacket.\n\nThis tour requires a good deal of walking, with some gentle slopes and a few stairs. Wear comfortable shoes.\n\nThere are plenty of places to buy food and drink along the way, but city prices can be expensive. Carrying your own bottle of water is a good idea if you don't like paying a lot for it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nIf staying near the CBD, you can simply pick up this walk at the nearest point to your accommodation.\n\nIf staying outside the CBD, catch a train to Town Hall Station or a bus to Town Hall on George Street for the starting point.
