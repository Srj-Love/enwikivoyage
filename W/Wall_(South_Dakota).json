They started to put up signs and billboards along the highway with the distance to Wall Drug. These signs have been spread around the world and to extreme polar reaches. It is joked that based solely on the billboards, future archaeologists will probably consider Wall Drug to be the most important building on the North American continent. From this seed of signs and billboards grew the tourist attraction that Wall Drug is today: giftshops, museums, restaurants, and of course the original drug store.
