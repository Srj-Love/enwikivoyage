The capital of Wallonia is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Namur"]]},", near its geographic center.\n\nWallonia used to have a very good economy, mostly based on charcoal-industry.

It is very hard to find a German speaker elsewhere in Wallonia outside this region, as French is the native language of many, is spoken throughout the region and also in Brussels though basically all, if not all, also speak French.\n\nForeign languages are not as widely spoken in Wallonia as in Flanders. Dutch is learnt in schools by many but people in Wallonia do not like to speak it in general. It is easier to find young people who can speak English but it can be hard to have a conversation in English with someone who is 40+. Surprisingly, Spanish is the third most spoken foreign language. \n\nAt any rate it can be very hard to find tourist and other useful information in English, even in famous tourist locations.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Formula One racing"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Spa"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=On the famous Spa-Francorchamps circuit."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Wallonia"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["50.5000"],["4.7500"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Belgium"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Wallonia"]]}]
