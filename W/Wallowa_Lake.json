After the gold rush occurred (ultimately populating the wallowas), the government took back most of its land from the tribe. Angered by this action, some of the Nez Perce retaliated by slaying some whites nearby. This turned into a long battle between the two forces.  Chief Joseph and his followers eventually surrendered, but were never able to return to the Wallowa Valley.  A tribute to Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce is present all throughout Wallowa Lake and its surroundings. It is still marked as one of the most influential struggles between native tribes and the injustice of the United States government. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nWallowa Lake is known for its calm water and gorgeous sites.
