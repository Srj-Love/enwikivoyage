By 1383, it had been given city rights by the Dukes of Brunswick and Lüneburg.  The Sculptor Hans Brüggemann, most famous for the cathdral's Bordesholmer altar, was born in Walsrode at the end of the 15th century.\n\nThe city was largely destroyed in 1626 by Tilly's troops in the Thirty Year War. Initially the war was based around a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics, Walsrode was largely a Protestant town and was thus destroyed by Johann t’Serclaes von Tilly. Things did not get any better for Walsrode in 1757, when the majority of houses were destroyed by the \"Great Fire\".\n\nWalsrode was first connected to the railway network in 1890.  It was joined to the railway line that went to Bremervörde, and eventually connected to the line between Hannover and Schwarmstedt.\n\nThe local poet Hermann Löns used his beloved heath around Walsrode for his novels and poems celebrating the people and landscape. You can still feel the magic of this vast landscape, with its splashes of colour from purple flowering heather, dark green junipers and bright yellow gorse bushes, surrounded by colourful forests, fertile fields and rolling river valleys.  Hermann Löns was buried in 1935 in Tietlingen grove.\n\nIn 1957 Walsrode becomes the site of the Federal Border Police where they also have a training and education centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hamburg International Airport"]},", 8km north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hamburg"]]},", is about 125km north from Walsrode, roughly an hour and twenty minutes' drive."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hanover Airport"]},", 11km north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hanover"]]},", is about 56km south of Walsrode, roughly 35 minutes' drive.
