",{"type":"''","value":["That"]}," is when you really understand Walt Disney's vision of a place where ",{"type":"'''","value":["kids and parents can have fun together"]},".\n\nWalt Disney World is enormous, a ",{"type":"'''","value":["multi-day resort destination"]},".  Each of its four theme parks is big enough to occupy visitors for a full day (and often two, depending on crowds).  Unless you live nearby, four days is considered the ",{"type":"''","value":["bare minimum"]}," length of visit to even begin to experience the resort; some people stay as long as two weeks and still bypass some attractions.\n\nTraveling to Walt Disney World represents a major pilgrimage for many American families.  The \"typical\" visit involves flying into Orlando International Airport, busing to an on-site Disney hotel, spending about a week without leaving Disney property, and returning home.  There are infinite variations possible, but this remains what most people mean when they talk of \"going to Disney World\".\n\nEverything at Walt Disney World is ",{"type":"'''","value":["carefully constructed and choreographed"]}," to maintain your perceptions of visiting an idealized world.  Company jargon frames every aspect of customer service as part of the \"show\": employees are \"",{"type":"'''","value":["cast members"]},"\", visitors are \"",{"type":"'''","value":["guests"]},"\", and every prop and costume must be completely \"in-character\" while \"on-stage\" (visible to guests).\n\nDisney prides themselves on customer service and friendliness.  You will never find garbage lying in the streets or bathrooms that are too dirty, and anything that is damaged is either removed or fixed immediately. The streets are almost sparkling and the buildings look brand new no matter what time of the day or year you are there.\n\nWhile some people find this attention to detail cloying and artificial, the vast majority of visitors are happy to immerse themselves in this relaxing, carefree environment.  Even so, the realities of Walt Disney World can be stark: long lines, sweltering heat, rude guests, and expensive merchandise are common.  There are ways to avoid the worst elements (namely by carefully choosing when to visit) and customer service is almost universally impeccable, even (or perhaps especially) when things go wrong.\n\nMany first-time visitors try to do too much during their stay.  Unless crowds are unusually small, this is a sure-fire recipe for burnout and exhaustion.  You need to have a basic schedule in mind, but you should remain flexible in order to account for closed rides, full restaurants, special events, and just changing your mind.  If the crowds get too heavy or the weather gets too hot, smart guests staying on-site head back to their hotels to relax, grab a snack, or take a swim, then return later in the day.  Trying to adhere to a rigid schedule will only frustrate you and your family, and you're not going to Walt Disney World to get frustrated, are you?\n\nWith some careful basic planning, an open mind, and a cheerful attitude, a visit to Walt Disney World can be whatever you want it to be: fulfilling, exciting, relaxing, enlightening, or just plain ",{"type":"''","value":["fun"]},".

He had his park, but he and his ",{"type":"'''","value":["Imagineers"]}," were constantly coming up with new ideas, ideas that just weren't going to fit inside Disneyland.  In the sixties, Walt began looking to the east coast, for a place with enough space to hold all of the ideas his team could dream up.  He found such a place in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Florida"]]},", southwest of the sleepy city of ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Orlando"]]}]},".  Here, along the new ",{"type":"'''","value":["Interstate 4"]},{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["I-4"]]},", there was plenty of space, far more than would be needed for just a single theme park.  Walt had grander ideas in mind for this \"Florida Project\" of his.\n\nAfter buying up over 27,000 acres (11,000 ha) of land on the sly, Walt announced his ambitious ",{"type":"'''","value":["Disney World"]}," plans to the world.  A theme park would be built, of course—a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Magic Kingdom"]}," on the north end of the property.  But to get there from I-4, guests would need to pass through the true centerpiece of the project: ",{"type":"'''","value":["EPCOT"]},", the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow"]},{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow"]]},".\n\nEPCOT was Walt Disney's largest, most revolutionary idea yet—a real city, with 20,000 real people living and working within, making use of the most advanced technologies to grow food, provide transport, and enhance quality of life.  Much of the technology was already in use at Disneyland—PeopleMovers and monorails, for instance—but these would not be amusement rides.  EPCOT was to be a place where the Imagineers' ideas were put to practical use, for the betterment of all mankind.\n\nAlas, it was not to be.  Walt died in December 1966, just as the Florida Project was coming to fruition.  Without Walt to drive the project, the company board refused to undertake the ambitious EPCOT plans.  But Walt's brother ",{"type":"'''","value":["Roy O. Disney"]},{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["Disney, Roy O."]]}," insisted the project as a whole go forward, starting with the Magic Kingdom.  Roy changed the project's name to ",{"type":"'''","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Walt"]}," Disney World"]},{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["Walt Disney World"]]},"; this new resort would be a tribute to Walt's vision, but would never really be the fulfillment of it.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Walt Disney World\/Magic Kingdom"],["Magic Kingdom"]]}]}," opened on October 1, 1971, with two hotels, a campground, and two ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Golf"],["golf courses"]]}," nearby.  It was an immediate success, single-handedly sparking the development of the Orlando area as one of the country's busiest vacation destinations.  Though Roy died before the year ended, he had succeeded in getting his brother's final project off the ground.\n\nWalt Disney World's first decade passed quickly, and by the time of its \"Tencennial\" celebration in 1981, a new theme park was being built in the space Walt had envisioned for EPCOT.  The new park would be called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Walt Disney World\/Epcot"],[{"type":"'''","value":["EPCOT Center"]}]]},", though it bore little resemblance to Walt's original plans.  Instead, EPCOT Center would be a sort of \"permanent world's fair\", combining ",{"type":"'''","value":["Future World"]},", made up of grand pavilions devoted to human progress, with a ",{"type":"'''","value":["World Showcase"]}," of meticulously detailed recreations of foreign lands.  EPCOT Center opened in 1982, and was followed by a combination theme park and movie studio called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Walt Disney World\/Hollywood Studios"],[{"type":"'''","value":["Disney-MGM Studios"]}]]}," in 1989, and then by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Walt Disney World\/Animal Kingdom"],[{"type":"'''","value":["Disney's Animal Kingdom"]}]]},{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["Disney's Animal Kingdom"]]},", a zoological theme park, in 1998.\n\nOver the years, numerous resort hotels and recreational activities were added to support the increased attendance at the multi-park resort.  Two large water parks were added in 1989 and in 1995.  In addition, a remote area of the property that started as Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village evolved into the Disney Village Marketplace, and eventually expanded to become ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Walt Disney World\/Downtown Disney"],[{"type":"'''","value":["Downtown Disney"]}]]},", an adult-oriented shopping and entertainment district.\n\nWalt Disney never would have imagined what Walt Disney World has become, and it is far removed from his original vision.  But one of his guiding principles was to \"keep moving forward\", and Disney World has done just that, becoming the largest and most popular theme park resort complex in the world.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Read"]},"\n\nEnough books have been written about Walt Disney World to fill a good-sized bookshelf.

They're also small enough to carry in your pocket as you tour the parks.\n\nSurprisingly, not much fiction has been written about the parks themselves.

The bad news is that you'll be packed like sardines next to 50,000 of your new closest friends, you'll wait two hours to go on rides like Splash Mountain and Soarin', and you'll be paying a premium for the privilege.  In the summer, you also get to listen to the kids complain about the heat.  On the bright side, though, you'll have plenty of company, the parks are guaranteed to be open late, and as many rides as possible will be up and running.\n\nIf your schedule allows any flexibility at all, you should avoid these peak periods.  Attendance is lowest in October, November (pre-Thanksgiving), December (pre-Christmas), and January.  These can be very good times to go; crowds are low and prices are too, but keep in mind that you may find that several rides are shut down for maintenance, and the parks have shorter operating hours.  In the winter, it's often too cold to go to the water parks, and you'll need a jacket at night.\n\nThe weeks between Easter and Memorial Day are another slow period, as well as the months of August and September; both periods provide a good balance of price, crowds, temperature, and operating hours, but you may need to take the kids out of school if you're bringing them along.\n\nOf course, you may want to coordinate your trip with a ",{"type":"'''","value":["special event"]},".

On top of this, you can add the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Park Hopper"]}," option, which allows you to enter multiple theme parks on the same day as many times as you like. You can also add the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Water Park Fun & More"]},{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["Water Park Fun & More"]]}," option, which grants admission to the two Disney water parks as well as other attractions.

(Exception: the Park Hopper option is only $49 for tickets less than four days.)  Neither one is likely worth it if you buy only a one-day ticket, but their value goes up sharply as you add more days.\n\nThe Park Hopper option in particular is often overlooked, but it's ",{"type":"''","value":["strongly recommended"]}," because of the flexibility it offers.  Without it, you could be stuck with nowhere else to go after doing everything you want to do at one park; or you could run out of time to do one last attraction and be unable to come back another day to pick it up.  If you have seven-day tickets, it costs less than $9 per ticket per day to add this option; the value of being able to visit one park in the morning and another in the evening should not be underestimated.\n\nWith the Water Park Fun & More option, you receive a number of admissions to attractions outside the four main parks.  The number is equal to the number of days on your Magic Your Way ticket (or two admissions for one-day tickets), though they can be used anytime.

Depending on which attractions you visit, the cost of the option may be covered by the money you save on admission after just two visits.\n\nMulti-day tickets do not have to be used on consecutive days. However, these tickets will expire 14 days after they are first used, so be sure to use all the days purchased prior to that. A ",{"type":"'''","value":["no-expiration option"]}," can be added to any multi-day ticket with at least one day remaining; with this option, the ticket expires when the last purchased day is used, which can be months or even years after the initial use. A side benefit of this option is locking in your admission price for your next visit(s). The price for this option is variable ($35–$325), based on the number of days remaining on the ticket.\n\nThe best feature of a Disney admission ticket is its flexibility. Options can be added even if the ticket has already been used at least once. For example, a base ticket (no park-hopping) can be upgraded to include park-hopping by paying the $59 cost for the option. Or, if a change in travel plans will not allow the user to utilize all purchased days prior to the ticket's expiration date, the \"no-expiration\" option can be purchased for the remaining days. These changes may be made at any ticket window or at the Guest Relations office inside each theme park as well as the Concierge desk at Disney Resort Hotels.

From Shades of Green (a military-only resort) it's a five-minute walk to Disney's Polynesian Resort, to take the monorail or ferry to the Magic Kingdom; and from the Polynesian Resort it's another five-minute walk to the Transportation and Ticket Center, to take the monorail to Epcot.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that you'll be doing a lot of walking ",{"type":"''","value":["within"]}," the parks, especially at Epcot and Animal Kingdom, so don't tire yourself out early!\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Strollers"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["wheelchairs"]},", and ",{"type":"'''","value":["electric convenience vehicles"]},{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["electric convenience vehicles"]]}," (",{"type":"'''","value":["ECVs"]},") are readily available to rent at the entrance to each park.

Most resorts have five bus routes originating from them, providing direct service to ",{"type":"'''","value":["all four theme parks and Downtown Disney"]},". Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach are served by the Downtown Disney and Animal Kingdom routes respectively.\n\nDisney's Boardwalk is actually part of a resort, so visitors from other resorts (except Swan\/Dolphin or Yacht\/Beach Clubs) will have to travel there via one of the parks.  The most convenient option is Disney's Hollywood Studios, which has two connections to the Boardwalk: walking or ferry. (Although Epcot is the closest park to the Boardwalk, using it as an interchange is not recommended, as it would require entering through the main entrance and exiting out the back entrance, thereby costing the admission fee.)\n\nNote that there is no bus service to the Magic Kingdom or Epcot from the Magic Kingdom-area resorts; they are served by the monorail system.  Likewise, service to Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios from the Epcot-area resorts is by ferry or walking.  There is also no direct bus service between the theme parks and Downtown Disney.  To travel to Downtown Disney from a theme park, or vice versa, you must travel to any resort and change buses. The most convenient resort for this purpose is Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort, which is right next door to Downtown Disney; you can get there via a pedestrian bridge, bus, or ferry.\n\nThe buses are reliable, fairly efficient, and reasonably comfortable, but they can be slow and inconvenient if, for example, you are traveling with young children or strollers. You may wait up to twenty minutes for a bus to your destination, and another ten to thirty minutes to get there—possibly longer during the busy season.

The distance is about half a mile, and takes around 10 minutes.\n\nMonorails generally run from an hour before park opening to an hour after closing.  Most of the time that'll be enough for anyone, but if you're using it to transit between resorts (for, say, a late dinner reservation), you might want to double-check the exact hours at your resort's front desk.  You might also have a problem with early-morning breakfasts and tour appointments, but again the front desk can help you arrange alternative transportation.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nWalt Disney World also has several waterways which are used by ",{"type":"'''","value":["ferryboats"]}," to transport guests.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["From the Magic Kingdom, large ferries transport guests to the Transportation and Ticket Center, adjacent to the parking lot.

MagicBands are rubber wristbands that you can wear all day around the parks.  Each member of your party gets one, and you use it to gain admittance to the parks and access FastPass+ queues. If you're staying at a Disney resort, the MagicBand will also unlock your hotel room, and you can use it to charge purchases to your room account or access meal options from your Disney Dining Plan. The MagicBands use RFID wireless technology, so all you have to do is wave your wrist near a special Mickey-head sensor, and you're all set.\n\nIf you are staying at a Disney resort, you can have each member of your party pick a color, and Disney will send you your MagicBands ahead of time. (If not, you can still use MagicBands, but you'll have to buy them for $12.95 each once you get to the park.)  Disney sells decorations for your MagicBands, so you can customize their look.\n\nYour MagicBands are automatically tied into your ",{"type":"'''","value":["My Disney Experience"]}," account (see next section).\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["My Disney Experience"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/disneyworld.disney.go.com\/plan\/my-disney-experience\/ ",{"type":"'''","value":["My Disney Experience"]}]}," is an integrated platform, a one-stop shop for all of your trip information.\n\nSetting up an account using the web site and connecting it to your trip reservation allows you to access all of your reservations: your Disney hotel stay, your FastPass+ times, and your Advance Dining Reservations. (It also lets you choose your MagicBand colors ahead of time!) Even if you're not staying at a Disney resort, you can create an account and hook it up to your admission media (MagicBand or card) once you get to the parks. You can review and make changes to your FastPass+ choices or ADRs both from the site and from the My Disney Experience mobile app",{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["app, mobile"]]}," (iOS or Android only).\n\nThe app has a number of other features, too, like an interactive park map and access to current attraction wait times.

While it's never a good idea to wander the parks with your eyes locked on your ",{"type":"'''","value":["mobile phone"]},{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["cell phone"]]}," all day, the usefulness of the My Disney Experience app means you probably don't want to leave it in your hotel room, either.

(During the least busy times, you'll rarely see more than 45 minutes, though.) As great as the attractions are, they are rarely worth standing in a three-hour line. One option for avoiding these lines is the free service known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["FastPass+"]},", available at pretty much every attraction that experiences wait times of more than a few minutes. FastPass+ allows you to schedule your visit to an attraction ahead of time, and then enter the attraction using a dedicated queue that bypasses the standby line.\n\nFastPass+ replaces the old FastPass system, in which you had to visit the attraction, get a FastPass ticket, and then come back at a designated time. Now with FastPass+, you no longer have to keep track of paper tickets; your scheduled ride reservations are stored on your admission media (card or MagicBand). Guests staying at Disney resort hotels can select their FastPass+ attractions 60 days before their trip using the My Disney Experience mobile app or web site; off-site guests have to wait until 30 days prior (though of course you'll need to buy your park tickets at least that far in advance to do so). Don't worry if you forget, or can't make the reservations in advance; you can still make FastPass+ reservations after entering the park. This can be done at kiosks located throughout the park or (at least for the time being) with cast members stationed throughout the park.\n\nThere is a catch, though: you can only schedule three FastPass+ attractions ahead of time, and all three have to be at the same park. But don't worry; after your third attraction's scheduled time, you can continue making reservations one at a time for the rest of the day, and those additional attractions can be at any park. Also, if you get to your FastPass+ attraction and discover that its standby line is super short (making your FastPass+ worthless), you can change it on the fly to another attraction.\n\nIf the demand is high, you might find that you can't get a FastPass+ reservation for your preferred attraction. Early indications are that this should be rare, but it could happen. Also, be aware that the FastPass+ queues may bypass some or all of the scenery and theming found in the longer lines, which for some guests is a significant part of the Disney experience. Consider what you may be missing if you choose to get a FastPass+.\n\nThis information is changing very quickly as FastPass+ is rolled out; please check with your reservations agent, your front desk cast members, or Guest Relations cast members if you have any questions or concerns.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Theme Parks"]},"\n\nThe four ",{"type":"'''","value":["theme parks"]}," are Walt Disney World's bread and butter.  These are not traditional amusement parks, where age is a hindrance to full enjoyment.  The Disney parks have rides, sure, but many of them are quite sedate and can be enjoyed by everyone, not just those with a high tolerance for thrills.  And even beyond the rides, there are stage shows to watch, shops to browse, characters to meet, and atmosphere to soak in.\n\nMost importantly, though, none of these rides, shows, and stores just \"sits there\".  Each one ",{"type":"'''","value":["tells a story"]},", in much the same way that Disney's animated films do, and each is crafted with the utmost care and attention to detail.

Keep in mind that parades and some shows occur only at specific times, and plan your route to put you nearby in time to get a seat.  Be flexible, though—once you've hit your priority attractions, you can go back and pick up more if you have time remaining.\n\nThe traditional amusement park advice of arriving early and heading to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["back of the park first"]}," tends to work well, although more and more guests are starting to catch on, so the benefit may be reduced.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["The Magic Kingdom"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Walt Disney World\/Magic Kingdom"],[{"type":"'''","value":["Magic Kingdom"]}]]},", based on the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California, is the most popular theme park in the world. It is organized around the central landmark of Cinderella Castle, with various \"lands\" arrayed around a central hub: Main Street USA, Adventureland, Frontierland, Liberty Square, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland. \n\nThe park is the oldest, most crowded, and the most child-friendly, although many adults love it as well.

Though the FastPass system works well, it is not available for all attractions.  Even just walking around, you will likely encounter bottlenecks where there are huge masses of people, and they all seem to be going to the same place you are.  Then there's the food and the merchandise, which can be pricey, but not too bad considering where you are.

While light on rides, there are also shows and plenty of animals to view (though the variety of species seems a bit sparse when compared to many larger city zoos).

Kids and adults alike can give hugs to, take a photo with, or get autographs from many of their favorite Disney characters.  Some kids like to bring or purchase a special autograph book in which the characters can inscribe their names.\n\nCharacter appearances tend to be surprises (to avoid huge lines), so keep a close eye out.  If there's a character your child really wants to see, you can ask at Guest Relations if they know of any upcoming appearances, but nothing is ever guaranteed.  And remember that it's hot inside those character costumes; sometimes the character has to leave even if there are people still waiting to say hello.  It's disappointing but necessary for safety.\n\nMost often, character greetings will happen in the parks, in particular the Magic Kingdom, but they can happen just about anywhere!  The Magic Kingdom does have the widest variety of characters, though; everyone from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mickey Mouse"]},{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["Mouse, Mickey"]]}," to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Captain Jack Sparrow"]},{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["Sparrow, Captain Jack"]]},".  Disney's \"Big Six\" (Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy, and Pluto) might be found anywhere in the park—for example, you might see Donald Duck in a Davy Crockett-like outfit in Frontierland.  Other characters stick to the themed land most appropriate for their genre: Jack Sparrow in Adventureland, Buzz Lightyear in Tomorrowland, and so on.\n\nAt the other parks, character appearances are somewhat rarer.  At Epcot, for instance, you'll generally only find characters who hail from one of the themed foreign lands of World Showcase—Mulan in the China pavilion, for example.  Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom tend to have more structured greetings, where characters will make scheduled appearances at designated locations, but stay out of sight of most of the park.\n\nIf you miss out on random encounters with the characters, be sure to look into ",{"type":"'''","value":["character dining"]}," options.

More than ",{"type":"'''","value":["60,000 different pin designs"]}," have been produced since the beginning.\n\nGetting started is easy.  Most every store has pins for sale ($7–$14 each), along with lanyards on which to display them.  You can also get a starter pack with pins and a lanyard for $20–$60.  These pins are generally not very valuable, so you'll need to trade up to get the more interesting (and much more rare) pins.  The most reliable way to do so is to keep an eye out for Cast Members wearing pin lanyards.  Cast Members are required to trade one-for-one if asked (up to two per guest per day) and can't refuse a trade based on pin rarity or design (although they can refuse to accept another copy of a pin they already have displayed).  Cast Members with green lanyards will trade only to kids under 13.\n\nYou can also trade with your fellow guests, and here things can get interesting.  You may need to offer several more common pins to get your hands on a single rare pin.  Dedicated traders carry a supply of common pins for just this purpose.  Your best way to find people willing to trade is to head to a dedicated pin kiosk or store, such as the one underneath the Sorcerer's Hat at Hollywood Studios, but there is also ample opportunity for trading while waiting in lines or while riding the monorail or bus.\n\nSome tours and special events have unique pins that can only be obtained by participants.

",{"type":"[[","value":[["Walt Disney World\/Hollywood Studios#Buy"],["Disney's Hollywood Studios"]]}," is a particularly rich source of themed merchandise, especially for fans of Indiana Jones, ",{"type":"''","value":["Star Wars"]},", and the Muppets.\n\nSometimes overlooked by shoppers are the various resorts.

In fact, each of the resorts has something a little different that you won't find elsewhere on the property, and it can be fun to look for those little hidden gems.\n\nRealizing that many of its souvenirs such as the giant Mickey dolls simply aren't made to be lugged around a theme park all day, Disney will save the day with its ",{"type":"'''","value":["package pickup"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["package delivery"]}," services, available at all Disney-run stores. Guests staying at an on-site resort hotel can have their purchases delivered to their hotel gift shop, while all guests can have their purchases held at the Package Pick-Up window at the front gate of each theme park. Both services are free of charge, but be sure to factor in delivery times—allow 24 hours for a package to be delivered to your hotel, or about three hours for it to reach the front gate of the park.\n\nIf you're stuck at home and dying to get some merchandise from the parks, you're in luck:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Walt Disney World Mail Order"],["url="],["email=wdw.mail.order@disneyworld.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 407 363-6200"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 407 352-6369"],["hours=M-F 9AM-8PM"],["price="],["content=Shop Walt Disney World from home!

If you get your dollars directly from Disney, you'll only be able to get the latest series.  They can be obtained at any park's Guest Relations location, and at most resort front desks, or you can contact Walt Disney World Ticketing, +1 407-566-4985, if you want to get them before your trip.

Happily, this has all changed in the last 15 years or so.\n\nThe small stands usually sell pre-packaged treats and snacks.  The counter-service restaurants are on par with most chain fast-food joints in quality, but significantly more expensive in price.

Don't feel like you have to leave the kids behind, either; every restaurant on property (except Victoria and Albert's) welcomes kids and will serve them as best as they can.\n\nFor those with dietary restrictions such as allergies, Disney restaurants won't leave you guessing. At quick-service restaurants, a manager is available to assist in determining available options. They can provide a book listing all dishes available at their particular location, categorized by many common food allergies, as well as complete ingredient lists. At full-service restaurants, a chef will speak directly to the patron to determine the available options or alternatives. \n\nIf a dietary restriction requires you to bring your own food into the parks, it is permissible to do so, on the condition that it does not require heating or any other kind of preparation. To ensure freshness, carry it in an insulated lunch box or bag. Keep in mind, though, that Florida Department of Health regulations prohibit Disney's Culinary Cast Members from preparing, or even handling, foods brought in by guests.\n\nIf you're interested in making sure your kids (or your spouse) get ",{"type":"'''","value":["healthy meals and snacks"]},{"type":"{{","value":[["index"],["healthy meals and snacks"]]},", keep an eye out for the new ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mickey Check"]}," logo, introduced in 2012 and prominently displayed next to the healthiest options on menus and snack stands.

In addition, all of the restaurants at Downtown Disney, even those run by outside companies, also accept the Dining Plan.  \n\nThe Dining Plan is available at three different levels (prices are approximate):\n; Magic Your Way package plus Quick-Service Dining : Two quick-service meals and one snack per person per night.  Cost: $40\/night for adults and juniors, $16\/night for children 3–9\n; Magic Your Way package plus Dining : One table-service meal, one quick-service meal, and one snack per person per night.

Cost: $105\/night for adults and juniors, $30\/night for children 3–9\n\nThe Magic Your Way Premium and Platinum packages also include Deluxe Dining.  The \"Wine and Dine\" option offered in previous years is no longer available.  A \"snack\" as part of the dining plan is a single prepackaged item, piece of fruit, or soft drink at any counter-service, snack cart, or merchandise location.\n\nAll dining plans also include a resort refillable drink mug, one per person.  This plastic mug can be refilled at the quick service location at a guest's resort for their entire length of stay.  It cannot be refilled in the parks, but during the hot summer months, you can fill it with water from the many water fountains.\n\nSome \"signature\" restaurants, plus the dinner shows, require ",{"type":"''","value":["two"]}," table-service credits for one meal.  These restaurants are Artist's Point, California Grill, Le Cellier, Cinderella's Royal Table, Citricos, Flying Fish Cafe, Fulton's Crab House, the Hollywood Brown Derby, Jiko-The Cooking Place, Monsieur Paul, Narcoossee's, Wolfgang Puck's The Dining Room, and Yachtsman Steakhouse, plus the Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue, Mickey's Backyard BBQ, and Disney's Spirit of Aloha dinner shows.

The general consensus is that it is worth it only if you're certain you'll use every last credit in the plan, and that requires planning ahead and diligent use of reservations.

An ADR is sort of like a restaurant FastPass. Essentially, when you make an ADR, you are reserving a spot on the restaurant's waiting list.  When you arrive at the restaurant at your reserved time, you will immediately be placed at the top of the waiting list and get the next available table suitable for your party.\n\nThe importance of ADRs cannot be understated.  During the slowest times of the year, you may find you don't have any problem walking up to a restaurant and getting a seat within 15-30 minutes.  If you don't particularly care where you eat, or are willing to eat early or late, you can probably get by without ADRs.  But if you have your heart set on a particular restaurant, or you want to make sure you can eat right at noon or 6PM, you'll want an ADR.  And if it's peak season, better safe than sorry; without an ADR you may find yourself searching high and low for a table even at 8PM.\n\nOf course, you can also get by without ADRs if you decide to only eat at counter-service restaurants (which don't take reservations at all).\n\nA few restaurants are so popular that they regularly fill up even during the slowest periods.  ADRs are essential for these.

In-park dining opportunities range from snack carts to the most common fast-food joints to the less common table service restaurants. Bear in mind that the hours between noon and 2PM are generally considered the \"peak\" dining time in the parks. If you find yourself eating lunch within this time frame, expect to wait 30 minutes to an hour in line before being served, unless you have a reservation at a table service restaurant. As an alternative, some snack carts serve fairly large portions (such as smoked turkey legs in the Magic Kingdom's Frontierland), and have short lines most of the time.\n\nEvery park has low-cost meals in the $4–$5 range for kid meals and $7–$10 for adult meals at the sandwich shops, ethnic specialty nooks, cafeterias, and communal dining halls.
