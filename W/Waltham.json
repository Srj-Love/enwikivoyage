Located some 10 miles west of central ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]}," on the Charles River, Waltham is considered part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greater Boston"]]}," conurbation; even so, it still retains its own unique character amongst Boston's outer suburbs. It is sometimes called \"Watch City\" because it was home to Waltham Watch Company. Many high-tech companies have made Waltham their home. It is also home to Bentley College and Brandeis University.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nOne of the oldest of American cities, Waltham was first settled by British settlers in 1634 and officially incorporated in 1738. In 1813, the Boston Manufacturing Company was formed in Waltham by Francis Cabot Lowell. It was the first modern factory in the United States and history books have credited this as the beginning of America's industrial revolution. In 1854, the Waltham Watch Company was established by Aaron Dennison. The company went on to make the first watches with interchangeable parts and the first 100% American-made watch, designing advanced machinery that spread to other industries and led to America's industrial power. Waltham is also noted as the home of such famous persons as Governor Christopher Gore and General Nathaniel Banks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.massport.com\/logan-airport\/Pages\/Default.aspx Logan International Airport"]}]}," is the closest airport to Waltham, its about 20 minutes south.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]}," \n\nWaltham is accessible via Interstate 95 also called route 128 or the Mass Pike. This is of importance if you are flying in or out of Logan airport because you are going to take I-95 North to get into Waltham and vice versa to get back into Boston. But two things to keep in mind when driving on I-95 is there are two sets of toll plazas of $1.25 each. The second thing to consider while driving is, the time of day because rush hour can set you back anywhere between 25 to 30 minutes between 4:30 and 6:30 pm.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nThere are several trains that go in and out of Boston daily. To get into Waltham from Boston, take the Fitchburg line from North Station on the MBTA ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/"]}," Commuter Rail to the Waltham or Brandeis\/Roberts stop. The trains are a good why to get into Boston especially on the day of a sports game because they go directly into The Boston Garden and a couple blocks over from Fenway Park. They are moderately priced which is also a plus. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nLocal MBTA buses 70 and 70A run from Central Square in Cambridge to Waltham.  Several MBTA Express Buses (553, 554, 505) serve Waltham Center. They all originate several blocks from South Station in Boston and go to Waltham on weekdays only. Buses are usually reliable and inexpensive, so they can be useful but tend to get crowded around rush hour as well(4:30 to 6:30).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nDriving around Waltham is not difficult and you can be just about anywhere in the city in 15 to 20 minutes. There are three main streets to Waltham they are, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Main Street, Moody Street, Lexington Street"]}," and while they are the best way to travel throughout the city. During rush hour(4:30 to 6:30) you will hit some traffic that may slow down your commute 10 to 15 minutes. Main Street is probably the worst during that time, and Moody Street can also be busy on a Friday or Saturday night. Parking is accessible with several public parking lots in high traffic areas, as well as on street parking.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThere are local city bus, that are an ok way to get around the city. They are cheap and usually reliable, but can get crowded and stuffy at times. The best place to catch the bus from is on the Common, the bus stop is directly across the street from the train stop.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Charles River Museum Of Industry"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.crmi.org"],["email="],["address=154 Moody Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 781 893-5410"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Th-Sa 10AM-5PM"],["price="],["content= Exhibits on textile mills, American Waltham Watch Company and a power plant."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Waltham Museum"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.walthammuseum.com"],["email="],["address=25 Lexington Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 781-893-8017 or +1 781-893-9020"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Tu-Sa 1PM-4:30PM"],["price="],["content= An extensive collection of memorabilia including watches, clocks, automobiles and other industrial products made in Waltham.
