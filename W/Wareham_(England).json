Its origin lies far back in centuries but its ramparts have been defensive walls for Caesars and Alfreds men and were not dismantled as a fort until the days of Cromwell.\n\nThe Britons set them up, the Romans reinforced them and they remain an astonishing spectacle in a 21st-century town.\nWarehamRiverThe Romans laid out the four main streets of Wareham following the points of the compass and everywhere in this town is something to remind us of the past. Wareham has had a castle, a priory, and eight churches of which most of them, along with most of its old houses, have been destroyed by fire.\n\nThere is a fine new bridge across the Frome replacing the 18th century one on which a curious stone, now in the museum, threatened transportation to anyone who dared to damage the bridge. A similar stone is still existing on the bridge in Wool.\n\nNear the bridge is the neat old warehouses and the quay belonging to Wareham’s active past.\n\nThe house called the Priory stands on the site of the priory the Saxon Aldhelm founded and reflected in the waters of the Frome is the embattled tower of the old church of St Mary’s. This great church with a thrilling history of something Roman, something Saxon and something Norman, it still preserves within its walls the stone coffin in which they laid poor King Edward who was murdered by his stepmother Queen Elfrida at Corfe Castle.\n\nWe can turn up at the entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for March 18, 979, which tells us:\n\nThis year, King Edward was slain at eventide at Corfe Castle, and buried at Wareham. No worse deed has been done than this among Englishmen since they first sought Britain. Men murdered him, but God glorified him.\n\nHere Edward is said to have lain in unhallowed ground for three years until Dunstain took him away and buried him in Shaftsbury. There he lay for a thousand years in a little lead coffin in which his bones were found in our time, having been transferred from this stone coffin in St Mary’s.\n\nOne of the chief treasures of St Mary’s is its lead font, a unique member of only 38 in England but is especially unique because it has six sides whereas all but one of the others are round.\n\nNear the font is a small room with a great fascination for those who love old things and old tales. In this room are cases containing Roman pottery and medieval tiles dug up in Wareham’s fields and gardens, between two pewter Cromwellian flagons is a handsome brass almsdish with a decorative rim embellished in the middle are two men carrying grapes slung from a pole resting on their shoulders.\n\nThis ancient dish has a remarkable story, something incredible but known to be true.\nOne night towards the end of the 19th century a lady staying at the rectory had a vivid dream, which she told the rector.\nIn it she had been told that if the panelling of the chancel were taken down something (she knew not what) would be found behind it.\nThe rector and all who heard her tale laughed but at her insistence the panelling was removed and the almsdish found.\n\nIt is thought it was hidden away during the Commonwealth.\n\nOne of the most captivating place in Wareham is the little church of St Martin’s-on–the- Wall, made new 700 years ago but with a Saxon window in its saddle back tower and the long and the short work of the Saxons. It was founded by Aldhelm.\n\nIt is thrilling to think that this small building was set up by the founder of Sherborne Abbey. Deserted for years, it has now been restored, reconsecrated and brought into almost daily use again. It has something in it almost one thousand years old, the chancel arch the Saxons built, with the rebuilding of the Normans and of the many ages since. There are old roof beams and some painted stars of great antiquity.\n\nOne of its chief possessions is the fine figure of Lawrence of Arabia given by his brother.\nSculptured by Eric Kennington, it shows him in Arab dress lying with his head on a camel saddle,his sandled feet supported by a Hittite stone whilst by his side the three books he always carried with him.\nLawrence_s_Effigy\nHis house which is cared for by the National Trust, and open to the public, is at Clouds Hill near Bovington and his remains lie in the graveyard of St Nicholas Church at Moreton.\n\nWareham has a vivid history, from the Danes ravaging the town and then establishing themselves there, through the brutal Judge Jefferys hanging his victims on the walls and King John sending to death poor Peter of Pomfret, who had prophesied his doom.\n\nApart from its fine bridge, its wonderful earthen walls, its fascinating churches and its little quay, there is much to make Wareham lovable. Its bright streets, charming squares, enchanting houses, splendid views and delightful riverside walks makes it a must for visitors to the Purbecks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nSouth West Trains\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nBus or trains\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Corfe Castle, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.corfe-castle.co.uk\/"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Tank Museum, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tankmuseum.co.uk\/home.html"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Wareham Town Museum, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wtm.org.uk"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Monkey World"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Lawrence of Arabia’s cottage and grave"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Lulworth Castle"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Swanage Steam Railway"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Clay Pigeon Shooting, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.shooting.uk.com\/"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=WarehamDorset.com"],["url=http:\/\/www.warehamdorset.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A helpful guide to attractions and accommodation providers in Wareham, the Gateway to Purbeck."]]}]},"\nRide on the row boats\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Heirlooms Antique Jewellers"],["url="],["email="],["address=21, South Street, Wareham."],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +44 1929 554207"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Family-run jewellers, specialising in antique and modern jewellery and silverwares.
