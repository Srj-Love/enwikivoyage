The town has many interesting buildings, nearly all of which owe their existence to Warminster's great fame as a successful corn market for several centuries. The corn market ceased a hundred years ago and Warminster is now a residential place, with some light industry and a military presence, but has for many years been a holiday haunt, providing visitors and tourists with beautiful countryside, ancient archaeological monuments, excellent recreational activities including walking and cycling and horse riding, plus shopping and plenty of enjoyable attractions large and small. It is ideally located, on the edge of Salisbury Plain and at the head of the picturesque Wylye Valley, between the historic cities of Bath (16 miles away) and Salisbury (20 miles away). Longleat House and Safari Park, and the Center Parcs resort of Longleat Forest are on its doorstep. For the holiday maker, Warminster is the perfect place to stay, as a base for visiting nigh on 100 places of interest, including Stonehenge, Avebury, Salisbury Cathedral, Bath Theatre Royal, the Science Museum at Wroughton, to name but a few. And Warminster itself cannot be bettered for the relaxation it offers. Residents already know that wherever they live in Warminster, it's only a few steps to the surrounding open countryside. Cley Hill, Arn Hill, Battlesbury and Scratchbury Hills, in the immediate vicinity, boast Iron Age hill forts; Copheap Hill and Middle feature burial mounds and strip lynchets.

Strings of bulbs and decorations above East Street, Market Place, High Street, George Street and Silver Street are complemented by hundreds of illuminated Christmas trees above nearly every shop front. These are put up (and taken down) by a dedicated team of volunteers. The cost of the trees is met by shopkeepers and business people. A first for the Christmas Lights team in 2009 was the staging of a Christmas Market in the Market Place with stalls, children's roundabouts, hot food and mulled wine, Santa's grotto, and a stage where local bands and choirs performed for the public. Santa Claus, helped by the Mayor of Warminster and local schoolchildren officially switched on the Christmas Lights at dusk. This market has been held again since 2009 but did not take place in 2012. It is hoped it will become a regular attraction. In the evenings in December, members of Warminster Lions Club, tour the town's residential streets with Father Christmas in a motorised \"sleigh\", handing out sweets to children and playing recorded festive music and carols, at the same time as Santa's helpers go door-to-door collecting small donations of money for local charities."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Civic Trust Garden"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.warminstercivictrust.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Conceived by Warminster Civic Trust.

The Were stream, which partly gives Warminster its name, flows through the Town Park. The main entrance is from Weymouth Street but access can also be gained from all sides including the Ridgeway Slope which was landscaped in 1977 and won an award from the Council for the Protection of Rural England. The Lake Pleasure Grounds feature tennis courts, a refreshments kiosk, and a bandstand where, during the summer months, visiting brass and other bands give free concerts on some Sunday afternoons. Also here is the Warminster Park Community Centre, used by many community groups including the Warminster Camera Club and the Wednesday Evening Bingo players. The boating lake has two islands giving a haven to ducks, swans and herons, who seem to ignore the human users of the pedaloes on the lake. The boathouse includes unisex toilets. There are three play areas in the Park: the King George V Playing Field has slides, swings, roundabouts, climbing frames, rocking horses and a paddling pool. Next to it is the Adventure Playground for the more energetic. The Skate Park is complete with half-pipes for use by skate-boarders, roller-skaters and BMX bikers. For those who want to take life at an easier pace there are seats situated alongside the path which circles the lake. The Morgan Memorial Fountain (now out of use), which stood in the busy Market Place until 1937 is now situate at the western end of the Lake Pleasure Grounds. It is adjacent the Civic Trust Garden.

Most of those taking part, though, are local entries comprising the carnival royalty, marching bands, motorised floats, majorettes and walking masqueraders. It is run entirely by a small but very dedicated group of volunteers who spend all year fund-raising to put the show on the road.

Solicitations of small change from the crowds are counted up afterwards and donated to local charities. The carnival entries are judged en route and the best are awarded cups and prizes. Spectators can also vote for their favourite entry which is awarded the Danny Howell Spectators' Shield.
