The city started to develop rapidly beyond the what is now the Old and New Town, as noblemen started moving in and building mansions and palaces around town. In the 17th century, Praga, on the right-hand side of the river Vistula, was incorporated as a separate town (and did not become a part of Warsaw until the 19th century).\n\nWhile ravaged by wars and natural disasters as many other European cities in this period, Warsaw continued to grow and modernize, with baroque residences, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warsaw\/Wilanów"],["Wilanów"]]}," being built in the 17th century, and the Saxon kings initiating first large-scale urban planning projects in the early 1700s. The last king of independent Poland, Stanisław August Poniatowski, has further modernized the city following the ideals of Enlightenment in the second half of the 18th century.\n\nAt the end of 18th century, the weakened Republic of Poland has been partitioned, through a period of forced diplomacy, military actions and uprisings, and Warsaw first fell into the Prussian rule, losing most of its importance. As the French emperor Napoleon marched eastwards with his army, he reestablished a small Polish state known as the Duchy of Warsaw, after its eponymous capital, but it was short lived and was absorbed by the Russian empire in 1815, after Napoleon's defeat.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Under Russian rule"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Karte Warschau MKL1888.png"],["250px"],["thumb"],["German map of Warsaw from 1888"]]},"\nWarsaw indeed remained a capital city under the Russian rule, as the Kingdom of Poland was reestablished, although with Russian tsars as hereditary kings and not much political independence. Warsaw was then the westernmost of major cities of the Russian empire and thus enjoyed economic growth as a commercial and industrial centre. While repeated uprisings and attempts to regain independence failed, Warsaw was still enriched with the creation of many cultural and educational institutions, many surviving to this day.\n\nWarsaw's growth was curbed by a double line of military forts, protecting the strategically important Russian outpost, which by the second half of the 19th century made Warsaw one of the most dense and overpopulated cities of its time. To aid the failing hygiene, the authorities started constructing the pioneering Warsaw waterworks (led by William Lindley), and first district heating and warm water installations were laid.\n\nAt the turn of the century, Warsaw was electrified, gaining its first electric power plant and electric tramways, as well as a telephone network. At the start of the First World War, Warsaw was bustling, modern city of almost 1 million inhabitants, rife with opulent, belle-epoque architecture adapted to its density.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Between the World Wars"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Warszawa 1935.png"],["250px"],["thumb"],["Warsaw in 1935"]]},"\nAs Poland regained independence, Warsaw became the capital city of an independent country again. It not only suffered heavily during the war, but was soon threatened by the advancing Soviet forces, who were only repelled at the borders in the 1920 Battle of Warsaw. While political instability and struggles ensued, Poland enjoyed economic growth, optimism and proper attention to planning and urbanism in that period, and Warsaw benefited from that greatly, especially under its last interwar President, Stefan Starzyński.\n\nWarsaw gained a state-of-the-art airport in Okęcie, a central railway through station connecting all major railway links that previously went through or terminated in the city, and even an experimental TV broadcasting station. Modern and attractive planned residential districts were created outside of the historic forts line, most notably northwards in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warsaw\/Żoliborz"],["Żoliborz"]]}," and Bielany. Warsaw continued to mix the new and old and many modern buildings filled in gaps between or replaced older buildings across the city, providing for the eclectic look Warsaw is known for also today.\n\nThe developments of that time, while later destroyed to a large extent in the Second World War, were instrumental to shaping Warsaw in many ways to how it was known today. Most were either rebuilt verbatim or in a similar form and place, while some survived.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Second World War"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Destroyed Warsaw, capital of Poland, January 1945.jpg"],["250px"],["thumb"],["Warsaw was all but razed during the Second World War"]]},"\nFor most of the Second World War, Warsaw was occupied by Nazi Germany, but did not surrender without major fights that affected the city - over 10% of the buildings were destroyed, while many other and the infrastructure were damaged. The German authorities treated Warsaw as expendable and had grand plans of eventually totally rebuilding it as a planned city, with Germanic and Nazi symbolism replacing all of the Polish heritage. This did not come into fruition in any form, but explained why little heed was paid to preserving the city, which was also periodically bombed by the Soviet forces after 1941.\n\nIt was an especially tragic period for the Jewish population of Warsaw, which had been a significant part of the general population over pretty much all of Warsaw's history. The Nazi forces confined Jews to the Warsaw Ghetto, sprawling over much of the district of Wola, and proceeded with their plans to annihilate them. This eventually led to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943.\n\nIn the final period of the War, the dramatic and tragic Warsaw Uprising took place in 1944 in the wake of the German defeat and Soviet march on Warsaw. It eventually led to the destruction of most of the remaining buildings in Warsaw and further staggering loss of life, while not achieving its goal of liberating Warsaw from the German forces before the Soviets would march in. The Red Army then captured the crippled and all but razed city cementing Poland's fate as a communist satellite state of the Soviet Union.\n\nIt is important to note that the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 and the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 are entirely separate historic events.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Post-World War II - rebuilding the city"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:A0069.jpg"],["250px"],["thumb"],["The Stalinist Palace of Culture and Science became a towering symbol of post-war Warsaw"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:2605201117DSC 0967.JPG"],["250px"],["thumb"],["Today, the Palace is surrounded by modern highrises"]]},"\nIn 1945, Warsaw stood almost completely destroyed. It is estimated that over 80% of the city was destroyed, including almost the entire city centre and most historic and significant buildings. Of almost 1.4 million inhabitants, half died during the war (including the vast majority of the Jewish population), others were forcibly removed or escaped voluntarily, and only about 10% of the initial population was found inhabiting the ruins of the city.\n\nTo rebuild the city was thus an enormous task, but there was no hesitation in the resolve to achieve it. A special committee of architects and urban planners conducted the efforts. Their paradigms shaped the city as it is known today. On the one hand, there was meticulous effort to restore the oldest and most important historic buildings using extant documentation, but also old photos and even paintings. On the other, the communist ideology ran very much against the character of pre-war Warsaw, and practical reasons and urban planning opportunities dictated planning on a larger scale, envisaging an expansive, much lower-density city.\n\nMost architects and historians held much the late 19th century architecture in low regard and thus many of the historic buildings and areas were rebuilt to resemble their shape in the 18th century or earlier, while ideological and practical reasons limited the restoration of ornamentation to less important buildings, and centralized urban planning provided for a much more harmonious look of the rebuilt historic sections of the city than could be witnessed from before the war. The restoration was mostly completed in the 1940s and early 1950s, but it took until the 1974 to rebuild the Royal Castle. After the Royal Castle, not many other buildings were restored - among notable exceptions are the buildings of the northern side of Plac Teatralny, only recreated in late 1990s.\n\nApart from historic restoration, in the 1950s Warsaw has also gained a fair share of socialist-realistic architecture, which was all about monumentalism and ideologically-themed decoration. Its most prominent example is the controversial Palace of Culture and Science, which grew to become one of Warsaw's symbols. The emphasis, however, was on housing the returning and rapidly growing population, and thus Warsaw also gained many nondescript, gray residential buildings. As population continued to grow and means were scarce in the centrally-planned socialist economy, the authorities turned to prefabricated concerte, creating sprawling ",{"type":"''","value":["Plattenbau"]}," estates around Warsaw.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Contemporary Warsaw"]},"\nSince the fall of communism in 1989, Warsaw has been developing much more rapidly than Poland as a whole.

The river's name is Vistula (Polish: ",{"type":"''","value":["Wisła"]},") and it crosses the city on a north-south axis, dividing it into two parts. The western part is usually referred to as the left bank (Polish: ",{"type":"''","value":["lewy brzeg"]}," adj.

Warsaw as such has been founded on the left bank, while the right bank was a separate municipality, called Praga, which was incorporated into Warsaw only in the 19th century. Therefore, many would refer to the right bank as \"Praga\", even if Praga proper is only two districts of the right bank.\n\nVistula in Warsaw is a broad, sprawling and unregulated river, which flooded the surrounding areas often in the past and continues to be somewhat of a threat today. Therefore, Warsaw is not really on the river in the sense many cities like London or Paris are, but rather near to the river, as Vienna is. The historic parts of left-bank Warsaw are a certain distance apart from the river, on an elevation called Warsaw escarpment. The part of left-bank Warsaw closer to the river (and less elevated with regard to it) called Powiśle was, until recently, of rather secondary importance and stature. The right bank is less elevated and most of the development there is separated from the river by a wide belt of shrubbery and natural beaches, allowing for flooding in periods of high tide.

One side of the street always has even numbers, while the other has odd ones (so if you are looking for number 8 and you see number 7, look at the opposite side of the street).

There are such machines at every metro station and at railway stations within the city centre, as well as at some of the more busy bus stops (e.g. at the Warsaw Chopin Airport). The ticket machines have a multi-lingual menu and are pretty easy to operate if you know ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warsaw#Ticket types and pricing"],["what ticket type"]]}," you want to buy. They accept credit and debit cards, as well as Polish zloty coins and bank notes. Do note some machines can be quite slow, so take your time and be patient for the machine to respond to your query.\n\nZTM has a network of service points where you can also purchase tickets. Those are the only places where you can have your personal travelcard made, which you would need if you intend to use a 30- or 90-day ticket.\n\nMany kiosks, shops and post offices also have tickets on sale - it is indicated by a sticker saying ",{"type":"''","value":["Sprzedaż biletów ZTM"]},". Do note, however, that an increasing number of shops and kiosks surrounding the major transit hubs do NOT sell tickets if there are ticket machines nearby.\n\nIn some buses and trams, there are ticket machines which can sell you tickets for the ride on that particular vehicle. They are different from other ticket types in that they have a printed QR code, and that they do not require validation. There are standard ticket machines in SKM trains as well. In case of ticket machine failure, you can purchase your ticket from the train attendant on board the train.\n\nIn case there is no ticket machine in the vehicle, or it is inoperable, the single-ride ticket can also be bought on board from the driver. You are advised to have the correct change ready. There is no extra charge for buying tickets from drivers, though they can refuse to sell you a ticket if they are over 3 minutes late. Do note that bus and tram drivers may not speak English at all, so tourists are better advised not to exercise this option.\n\nYou can find more information on purchasing tickets and ticket sale locations at the ZTM's English-language website: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ztm.waw.pl\/?c=177&l=2"]},".

If you buy a ticket from a driver, you still have to activate it. If you buy vehicle-and-fare ticket (with the QR code) in special ticket machine inside a bus or tram, you don't need to validate it.\n\nWhen entering the metro, you will need to validate or present your ticket to open the gate. There are other ways to access the platform for people with special needs (wheelchairs, strollers, large luggage etc.), such as elevators and open gates, so if you are intending on using those, make sure you find a yellow ticket validator before you descend to the platform - they should be next to elevators. Exit gates open without a ticket. Possession of a valid ticket is compulsory for everybody at the metro platform regardless of whether they intend to ride a train or not, even if just using it as an underground passage or accompanying someone.\n\nTimed tickets only need to be activated once, on your first journey. In case of carton tickets, the ticket validator will print the time limit until which the ticket is valid.\n\nTickets are ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," checked by the drivers. They may be randomly inspected in a station or in a bus\/tram by plain-clothes inspectors with portable ticket\/card readers, so it is up to you to have a valid (activated) ticket. The ticket inspectors in Warsaw are paid a commission on the number of fare-dodgers they catch, so they are rarely lenient and generally rather harsh to deal with.

For a quick bit, chain cafes that are around every corner in the city centre, the shopping centres and many office buildings will offer you pre-made sandwiches and salads. Some more sophisticated cafes will make salads, ciabattas and sandwiches on site.\n\nThere is no particular Polish kind of fast food, as the traditional Polish cuisine does not really lend itself well to quick preparation or quick eating. Therefore, apart from the above international chain places, that niche in Warsaw is filled with kebab places and cheap pizzerias, similar to ones that you would find in most other European cities. Pizzerias are often chain places as well, and many do telephone deliveries, takeaways as well as offer tables to eat on the premises.

After the fall of communism, most of them closed down but some survived and still bear the climate from the old days. Almost everything inside looks, feels and smells like in the 1980s.  Milk bars attract students and senior citizens, because of the low prices (soup and the main course together may cost as little as 10.00 zł).  The food served by milk bars can actually be quite palatable.

Warsaw still sees more business than leisure travel, so your best bet to get a great rate are weekend stays. Look for offers and special rates in booking sites and hotel web pages.\n\nIf you are on a budget, do not assume that hostels are your only option. Booking in advance at 3\/4 star hotels can yield prices only slightly higher than backpacker hostels, for far greater comfort.

When dialing from a mobile phone, you must dial any number as if it was an international number.\n\nPay phones are very rare and it is therefore best to rely on other means of communication. Pay phones are only operable using calling cards that can be bought at post offices.\n\nPre-paid SIM cards with Polish phone numbers cost as little as 5 zł and can be purchased from just about any major carrier. Many kiosks sell them.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nWarsaw is generally a safe city. The city center has a strong police presence and is generally a very safe area. The Praga districts are reputed to be dangerous, but this is generally more hype than reality.  Of course, it would be wise to exercise a little extra caution if you're in an area you do not know well.  The bus and rail stations can be a magnet for homeless and drunkards, who, for the most part, will leave you alone.\n\nPickpockets can sometimes be a problem and you should be careful to hold onto your belongings when in a large crowd or on buses (Number 175, which runs from the airport to city center, is reportedly infamous for pickpockets).  At bars and clubs, a good rule of thumb is the cheaper the door entry and the laxer the bouncers are about letting people in, the more likely you're going to want to keep extra care of your wallet, passport, cell phone, and camera.\n\nViolent behavior is relatively rare and if it occurs it is most likely alcohol-related. While pubs and clubs are generally very safe, the nearby streets may be scenes of brawls, especially late at night. Try to avoid confrontations. Women and girls are generally less likely to be confronted or harassed since the Polish code of conduct strictly prohibits any type of violence (physical or verbal) against women. Nationalist groups that have staged \"Independence Marches (Parades),\" which naturally coincide with Poland's November 11 independence, have become violent in the past with neo-Nazis groups burning cars, attacking pedestrians, and clashing with both the police and anti-fascist demonstrators, who can become violent also, as occurred in 2011.\n\nVisitors not knowing Polish may also be the target of \"bar girls,\" especially in Underground off of ul. Mazowiecka on days where there isn't a cover charge.  Be cautious if you encounter a girl speaking English who will offer you a drink or a cigarette.  She will then ask you to walk her to her car parked outside of the club and then explain how her friend still inside of the club has her car keys.  Then she will ask if you would like to share a cab back to her place for 70 zloty and then go back to the club.  Doing so puts yourself in danger because it isn't known where she lives and you could be setting  yourself up for possible harm or other scams.\n\nJust like in any other major European city, football hooligans can be a problem before or after large football events. Naturally, it's best to avoid them, because they might be violent. At the same time, all major sport events are monitored and controlled by special police units, so unless you find yourself in the middle of the confrontation between hooligans and the police, you should be fine.\n\nIn case of emergencies, call emergency services.
