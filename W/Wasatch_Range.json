Boasting incredible amounts of light powder snow, many ski resorts dot the mountains a short drive from Salt Lake City. A number of these resorts are storied in the annals of skiing history including Alta, which opened in 1938. In the summer the resorts can be explored for their tremendous beauty and for their mining history, which is extensive. Hikers will find a lifetime of trails in the Wasatch including the Pipeline trail in Millcreek Canyon, which is perfect for beginners and leads to impressive views of the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nThe area is also home to world class rock climbing of a number of varieties. From quartzite in Big Cottonwood Canyon, to granite in Little Cottonwood Canyon, and limestone in American Fork Canyon a number of rock types form impressive structures and have led to the development of thousands of routes. Bouldering, sport climbing, and traditional climbing, and alpine climbing are all well represented. In the winter climbers can test themselves on a number of ice climbs, head to the local climbing gyms, or drive a few hours to the storied cracks and towers of the Utah desert.\n\nThe Wasatch Front also sports impressive mountain biking terrain, which includes beginner rides on dirt trails all the way up to extreme mountain biking at ski resorts. Salt Lake County is completing a paved trail to follow the Jordan River. This trail, which will be accessible in sections or a full cross-county adventure, will be a joy for all ages and will be open to walkers and bikers with informational signs and resting places along the way.\n\nAs one would expect for an area with so many athletes, the Wasatch Front features a number of races, from the Wasatch Powder Keg backcountry ski race to any number of small 5k runs, there is almost always a race taking place.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Utah"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Wasatch Range"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["40.79"],["-111.61"],["zoom=8"],["layer=OB"]]}]
