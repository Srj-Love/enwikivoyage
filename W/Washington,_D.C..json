That incident made clear that the nation's capital would need to be independent from the then-powerful state governments and that the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South (United States of America)"],["southern states"]]}," would refuse to accept a northern capital.\n\nThree of the nation's founding fathers, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton, agreed in 1790 to a compromise location for a new national capital on largely uninhabited land along the Potomac River in the Mid-Atlantic. The exact location was left up to George Washington, who carved a diamond-shaped federal district out of land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, which just so happened to be near his plantation at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Vernon (Virginia)"],["Mount Vernon"]]},".

L'Enfant's plan, modeled after some of the leading cities in Europe, envisioned large parks and wide streets, including a grand boulevard connecting the \"President's House\" to the Capitol building. However, L'Enfant was an eccentric and fought bitterly with the commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction. President Washington ultimately dismissed L'Enfant, but the problems didn't end there. Issues with financing and a lack of skilled craftsmen slowed the construction of the city. The commissioners ultimately relied on African slaves lent from nearby plantations to complete construction. The federal government finally moved to the new capital in 1800, which by then had been named Washington in honor of its founder, though he still preferred to call it the \"Federal City.\"\n\nBritish forces invaded the city during the War of 1812, burning and gutting the Capitol, Treasury, and White House. And things didn't get much better for the new national capital. When he founded the city, President Washington originally thought that a flourishing trade would help support the capital, but the idea was short-lived. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park"],["Chesapeake & Ohio Canal"]]}," was built in 1831 to move goods from the western territories all the way to Georgetown, where they could then be loaded onto ships. However, the canal was unable to compete with the new and more efficient Baltimore & Ohio railroad. Alexandria suffered disproportionately, since the government's plans favored the port at Georgetown and all government buildings were, by law, built in the City of Washington. The economic stagnation, combined with fears that the federal government would ban Alexandria's thriving slave trade (and it eventually did), caused Congress to return all the District's land originally donated by Virginia. The 1846 \"retrocession\", as it is now known, spoiled the city's fine diamond shape, leaving only the land originally donated by Maryland under federal control.\n\nWashington's compromise location on the border of North and South proved precarious during the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Civil War"]},". Caught between Confederate Virginia on one side of the Potomac, and southern sympathizers in surrounding Maryland, President Lincoln established a network of forts surrounding the capital. As the center of war operations for the Union, government workers, soldiers, and runaway slaves flooded into the city. Despite the city's growth, Washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation. After the war, some members of Congress suggested moving the capital further west, but President Ulysses S. Grant refused to consider such a proposal.\n\nIn 1871, Congress created a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia charged with modernizing the capital. Sewers and gas lines were installed, streets were paved, and the town was transformed into a modern metropolis. However, the high cost of the initiative (and alleged cronyism) ultimately bankrupted the District government and later public works projects could not keep up with the city's growing population. By the early 1900s, L'Enfant's vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall. A plan enacted by Congress in 1901 beautified Washington's ceremonial core, re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new city-wide park system, finally developing the city into L'Enfant's intended grand design. The New Deal spending of the 1930s led to the construction of even more federal buildings, memorials, and museums. Government activity only increased with the coming of World War II and the city hasn't looked back since.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Wilsonbldg wts.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["The Wilson Building, seat of the Mayor and City Council"]]},"\n\nD.C.'s culture is in no small part defined by a ",{"type":"'''","value":["divide"]}," between black and white, native and transient, as well as cultural diversity from around the world. Compared to other cities, relatively few residents are native Washingtonians. Most recent census figures report that about 50% of the population has relocated in the past five years. The transient population is overwhelmingly professional, young, white, affluent, and highly educated—drawn to the city for its government-related work and booming economy. This is in stark contrast to the local African-American population, which has deep roots in the community, and much more socioeconomic diversity—some areas of the city rank among the nation's poorest, most alienated, and underprivileged, plagued with serious problems in the public schools and violent housing projects.\n\nD.C., a.k.a the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chocolate City"]},", was for the last half-century a solidly majority-black city, and has long been a national center of African-American culture.

D.C. is also home to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C.\/Shaw"],["Howard University"]]},", one of the nation's most important historically black colleges. While Washington is no longer a strictly majority-black city, the persisting influence of African American culture upon D.C.'s identity cannot be overstated in the popular consciousness, the city government, local sports, popular and high culture, and, above all, the local intellectual and philosophical movements.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["P Funk on D.C."],[{"type":"''","value":["We didn't get our forty acres and a mule,"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["but we did get you CC..."]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["A Chocolate City is no dream,"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["it's my piece of the rock and I love you CC."]}]]},"\n\nThe sometimes uncomfortable blend of the semi-transient professional population and permanent residents is often the source of controversy, especially as D.C. has been experiencing a wave of neighborhood rebuilding and \"gentrification.\" Young professionals with tight budgets and distaste for long daily commutes have, in recent years, been driven to move into poorer neighborhoods in search of low rent and easy access to city amenities.

Even if you plan on taking the Metro, bus, or driving (not recommended) to get downtown, you will often find yourself walking for the remainder of the day. Most of the city's attractions are located near each other, such as the museums and monuments along the National Mall, which makes driving or taking Metro between locations either impractical or in some cases impossible. Therefore, when touring around Washington make sure to wear good walking shoes and, especially during the spring and summer, wear comfortable and light clothing, apply sunscreen, and drink lots of water. During the summer, visitors would be wise to visit air-conditioned museums during the day, saving monuments, neighborhood tours, and other outdoor attractions for the cooler early morning and evening hours.\n\nWashington, D.C. has a variety of public transportation options that make the city extremely easy to get around without the use of a car. Trains, buses and bikes are affordable and widely used.

Take note of the quadrant, otherwise you may find yourself on the exact opposite side of town from your destination!\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:12-07-12-wikimania-wdc-by-RalfR-010.jpg"],["thumb"],["McPherson Square Metro station"]]},"\nCity streets are generally laid out in a grid, with east-west streets primarily named with letters (A–W) and north-south streets named with numbers. The street numbers and letters increase with distance from the Capitol building. The numerous diagonal avenues, many named after states, serve as the city's principal arteries; when walking or riding a bicycle they are the often quickest way to get around town. The avenues also enter many complicated traffic circles and have left-turn restrictions that vary by time of day, so take care while navigating these until you understand them.\n\nThe street grid has a few peculiarities that are a legacy from the city's foundation. The City of Washington originally occupied only a portion of the total area of the District. As a result, outside of what is now often called the \"L'Enfant City\" streets do not strictly adhere to the grid system. Given the lack of characters in the English alphabet, two-syllable names (e.g., Irving Street, Lamont Street) follow the single-letter streets, followed by three-syllable names further out. However, you will find that many streets were simply extended where practical. \n\nCurious to note, visitors to Washington will quickly discover that there is no \"J\" Street. This is because, until the mid-nineteenth century, the letters \"I\" and \"J\" were indistinguishable when written. Following that same idea, \"I\" Street is often written as \"Eye\" Street, to distinguish it from the letter \"L\" and the numeral \"1\", and \"Q\" Street is often written \"Que,\" \"Cue,\" or \"Queue.\"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Metro"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Infobox"],["Metrorail Hours of Operation"],[{"type":"*","value":["Monday-Thursday: 5AM-midnight"]},{"type":"*","value":["Friday: 5AM-3AM"]},{"type":"*","value":["Saturday: 7AM-3AM"]},{"type":"*","value":["Sunday: 7AM-midnight"]}]]},"\n\nFor tourists, it is usually much easier to get around the city using public transportation, since parking is expensive and driving in a crowded city is not easy.

Additionally, trains may terminate before reaching the end of the line, especially during rush hour. Therefore, be careful to note both the color and final destination indicated on the electronic displays and train cars before boarding.\n\nYou will encounter dense platform crowds and jammed train cars during weekday rush hours, especially on the Red and Orange lines, as hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians daily use the system to get to and from work.\n\nWhen riding Metro late at night, be aware of when the last train leaves each particular station. This information is available both online and within Metro stations. The last trains of the evening continue to the end of their respective lines, even after the system has technically closed; there is no need to worry that a train will stop before you reach your destination.\n\nAbsolutely no food or drink is allowed on trains or in stations. Metro employees, police officers, and even fellow riders will ask you to dispose of any food before entering. Violators are subject to fines or even ",{"type":"''","value":["arrest"]},". If you are carrying food\/beverages, keep them closed and in a bag.\n\nRider etiquette is key to smooth travel in the heavily-used system.  Try not to obstruct train doors when passengers are leaving the train.  Keep belongings off of the seats.  When using escalators in stations, stand on the right, and leave the left side free for those who want to pass.  Strollers must be folded at all times on the trains and in elevators.  These rules are especially important during the summer months when commuters are sharing the Metro with large numbers of out-of-town visitors.\n\nMetro train doors do not auto-retract, and are somewhat notorious for pinning passengers and their belongings. Use caution; it's normally a better idea to wait for the next train than to attempt boarding at the last second. If you or your belongings are caught in the door, wait for the train operator to re-open them. Do not try to block the doors or force them open; this often breaks the doors and forces the operator to take the entire car out of service.\n\nIf riding standing up, be sure to grab a stanchion or overhead bar when the train pulls into a station.  Braking is currently manual, and depending on the train operator's skill level can be quite abrupt, causing some passengers to lose their footing.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Circulator bus"]},"\n\nThe tourist-friendly ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/dccirculator.com\/ D.C.

Limited and expensive parking, ruthless parking enforcement, sadistic traffic circles, fines from automated red light cameras and absurd speed traps, a pothole epidemic, frequent street direction changes, some of the worst congestion in the country, street closures without warning—take the Metro. Forbes Magazine, in line with several university studies, declared the D.C. metro area to have the worst traffic in the nation, and the number two wasn't even close.

Avoid driving and parking during rush hour (weekdays, 7AM-10AM and 4PM-7PM), since this is when the majority of the city's traffic congestion, street direction changes, and parking restrictions are in effect.

Finally, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["W Hotel"]}," (West End), just a block from the White House, has a rooftop terrace, bar, and lounge. While the bar and lounge are expensive, a single cocktail gets a table for several people long enough to take in the view, and suave cheapskates can simply wander around long enough to get a load of the White House from above (close enough to make out the Secret Service overwatch) before heading back to the elevator.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Parks"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Rock Creek Park map.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Rock Creek Park map"]]},"\n\nThe District is home to many large parks that offer hiking and biking.

But truly, you can find just about any cuisine you want in this city if you look for it—D.C.'s international might draws representatives from all corners of the globe, and they all need ex-pat cafes and restaurants to haunt.

Adams Morgan's scene is the edgiest (and likely most exciting) of the three, and draws a really young, diverse crowd. Dupont Circle's scene is probably the biggest and most established, with sometimes frighteningly upscale clubs catering to extremely wealthy foreign clientele, as well as a more happy-go-lucky gay scene. Logan Circle is less established as a nightlife hot spot than Dupont, but the two areas otherwise resemble one another.\n\nIf these destinations are all a bit too high-octane, you should definitely explore the clubs around U St and 14th St in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C.\/Shaw"],["Shaw"]]},", which cater to an older, diverse, and self-regardingly more sophisticated crowd. Shaw is also a fantastic destination for ",{"type":"'''","value":["live jazz"]},", with echoes of Ellington ringing out from nearly every restaurant, bar, and not a few world-class music venues on Saturday nights. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C.\/Georgetown"],["Georgetown"]]}," is another major nightlife destination, although the emphasis here is less on dancing and more on drinking.

D.C. at the end of the 90s and into the current decade went from being one of the blandest, shut-down-at-ten-o'-clock American cities to having a thriving nightlife scene pretty much city-wide.

The result is ",{"type":"'''","value":["strange"]},". It may never be properly \"bohemian,\" but the Atlas District is intriguing. It's a poor but quickly gentrifying neighborhood, and is dead quiet most of the week, but now there are blocks worth of crazy dining\/clubbing options, and even a few upscale joints, that fill the street on Friday and Saturday nights. The biggest attraction has to be the Palace of Wonders, a vaudeville\/sideshow\/burlesque bar with sword swallowing bartenders and a \"museum of oddities,\" but there are also a couple surprisingly cool rock clubs, a mini golf bar, Belgian mussels and ",{"type":"''","value":["pommes frites"]},", and even an upscale wine bar and lounge.

For a more authentic Washingtonian experience, visitors might prefer to stay in one of the numerous hotels just a little further north in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C.\/Dupont Circle"],["Dupont Circle"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C.\/Shaw"],["Logan Circle"]]},", or just east in the historic ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C.\/Capitol Hill"],["Capitol Hill"]]}," neighborhood.

The downside to the West End is that the downtown commercial area is deserted after dark. A bit further west is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C.\/Georgetown"],["Georgetown"]]},", which is perhaps D.C.'s most charming neighborhood, with a wealth of smaller, expensive hotels in the midst of a great dining and nightlife scene. Take note, though, that Georgetown lacks a Metro stop (to keep out the riffraff), so you'll find yourself taking taxis or buses to get to the Mall and to other neighborhoods.\n\nIt's worth noting that Washington is a relatively small city, acreage-wise, and it's very easy and quick to stay in the close-in suburbs and take the Metro into town. You can save meaningful cash this way; suburban hotels are often substantially cheaper and D.C.'s hotel tax is an eye-popping 14.5%.

Certain neighborhoods in the less traveled parts of the city (especially near public housing projects) are the main contributors to D.C.'s high murder rate, but as a visitor to the city you are extremely unlikely to be victim of a homicide—the vast majority of homicide victims in the U.S. are acquainted with their murderer long before the crime, and there simply are not that many murders to begin with—robbery is a more travel-relevant problem.\n\nThe trickiest aspect of staying safe in D.C. lies in the fact that the most dynamic neighborhoods, sporting great nightlife, dining, and diversity, are home to the majority of the city's ",{"type":"'''","value":["muggings"]},".

That's not to say that visitors should avoid these areas—on the contrary, it would be a shame to miss out on them—but that visitors should be vigilant. In particular, avoid walking at night on side streets—stick to the well-lit main commercial strips, travel in groups, and maintain a basic level of sobriety, and you won't run into trouble. Be extra vigilant in this area with your expensive electronic devices, as they are a very popular snatch-and-grab item around the Metro stations.\n\nYou will often hear people warn away people from visiting the \"northeast\" and \"southeast\" sections of the city, but this well meaning advice is far too generalized to be of any real use. While some neighborhoods do indeed have severe problems with violent crime, particularly near city housing projects, most areas in the east of the city (particularly in the northeast) are simply quiet, peaceful residential neighborhoods—with a good deal less violent crime than gentrified neighborhoods in north central D.C. And there are a bunch of great places to visit with NE or SE addresses: Capitol Hill\/Barracks Row, the National Shrine, the National Arboretum, H St NE, Takoma, the Nationals Stadium, etc.\n\nLastly, the Metro is quite safe, and you should not shy away from using it at any time of the day.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Local laws"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Smoking"]}," is banned within almost all enclosed public spaces, including shops, restaurants, bars, clubs, and so on.
