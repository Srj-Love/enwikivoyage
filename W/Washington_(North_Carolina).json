It was the first city in America to be named after General George Washington, before he became the  first president of the United States.\n\nIn its infancy, Washington was a regional shipping center because of its strategic location at the junction of inland and coastal rivers. The shipping heritage is evident in some waterfront commercial buildings from that era. The architecture in the large residential and commercial Historic District captures later phases of Washington's history and development. Main Street in Washington's Historic Downtown is flanked by 19th and early 20th century commercial buildings punctuated with ornate brickwork.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Note's Cafe"]},"\n\n''143 North Market Street\n252-946-3321''\n\nYes, the place looks like a dress shop, the cafe is in the rear.  \nCoffee bar, cigars, espresso, smoothies, Jones sodas, specialty teas, biscotti, cookies.
