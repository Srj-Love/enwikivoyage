Prior to the arrival of explorers from Europe, the region had many established tribes of Native Americans, notable for their well developed economy, complex trade agreements, elaborate and generous culture and ornate art forms and carving. Prominent among their industries along the coast were salmon fishing and, notably among the Makah, whale hunting. \n\nThe first recorded European landing on the Washington coast was by Spanish Captain Don Bruno de Heceta in 1775. He claimed all the coastal lands up to Prince William Sound for Spain, which they maintained made the Pacific a \"Spanish lake\" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire.  Early European explores unwittingly introduced smallpox which decimated the native culture.\n\nIn 1778, British explorer Captain James Cook sighted Cape Flattery, at the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but Cook did not realize the strait existed. It was not discovered until Charles William Barkley, captain of the Imperial Eagle, sighted it in 1787. The straits were further explored by Spanish explorers in 1790 and 1791, and British explorer George Vancouver in 1792.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:San Juan Island NHP Eng Camp.JPG"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["The British Camp in the San Juan Island National Historical Park is the only part of a US national park that commemorates a British military site and the only one that flies the British Union Flag."]]},"\nThe British-Spanish Nootka Convention of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States. American captain Robert Gray (for whom Grays Harbor County is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the Columbia. Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in sea otter pelts. The Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the state on October 10, 1805.\n\nBritain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as \"joint occupancy\" of lands west of the Continental Divide to the Pacific Ocean as part of the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains. Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, west to the Pacific, were deferred until a later time. Spain, in 1819, ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession.\n\nNegotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the Oregon boundary dispute was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into Oregon Country, Hudson's Bay Company, which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the Columbia District.\n\nThe growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory, which was granted by the U.S. government in 1853. The boundary of Washington Territory initially extended farther east than the present state's, including what is now the Idaho Panhandle and parts of western Montana, and picked up more land to the southeast that was left behind when Oregon was admitted as a state. The creation of the Idaho Territory in 1863 established its eastern border at 117 degrees west. Washington became the 42nd state in the United States on November 11, 1889. It was the final state in the contiguous U.S. that has a coastline.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nWhile Washington (and especially ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seattle"]]},") is often portrayed as an extremely rainy place, the climate of Washington is actually very diverse. The part of the state east of the Cascades is quite dry and arid. In the Puget Sound area, it rains often but the volume is not as much as many other major cities. Being in a convergence zone the weather can change very quickly and is often times difficult to predict. The west coast of the Olympic peninsula is the rainiest part of the state and sustains lush rain forests.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe Pacific Northwest accent spoken in Washington State is considered very similar to the General American standard accent (native to the Midwest), popularized in the 20th century by radio, TV and movies. People in the area generally have little to no problem understanding different accents of the English language. The Pacific Northwest attracts tourists from around the world, and it is common to hear many foreign languages being spoken in public in major tourist areas. \n\nThere are ethnically diverse neighborhoods in some of the larger cities where many languages are spoken, including Seattle's large International District where many Asian languages are spoken.  Washington is the thirteenth most populated state for example, but by comparison has the fourth highest Asian population.  Spanish is spoken by the majority in some smaller pockets in eastern Washington and Oregon.

Chinook Jargon was still in use in Seattle until roughly the eve of World War II, making Seattle the last city where the language was widely used. Today its influence is felt mostly in place names and a handful of localized slang terms.  Pronunciation of some of these terms is difficult and often separates the visitor from the local.\n\nMany of the area names from Native American culture and may be difficult for outsiders to pronounce including Alki, Seattle, Kitsap, Yakima, Duwamish and Lummi.
