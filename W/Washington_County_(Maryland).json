The county is bordered to the east by South Mountain (part of the Blue Ridge Mountains) and to the west by Sideling Hill Creek. In the middle lies Hagerstown Valley, part of Cumberland Valley which is part of a larger Great Appalachian Valley. Washington County is noted for small towns dotting its idyllic rural landscape and abundant agricultural fields. It boasts only one city, its county seat Hagerstown. However, the county is part of the Hagerstown metropolitan area, and it is proximate to and becoming increasingly influenced by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C."]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltimore"]]},".\n\nWashington County is also well-known for being located in a historically significant area. Antietam, South Mountain, Gettysburg, Harpers Ferry, and Monocacy are Civil War battlefields all located within 30 minutes drive of the county. The county is also home to the restored American Revolutionary War and French and Indian War structure of Fort Frederick.\n\nEven with such historical significance, retail is the major draw for tourism in Washington County. Prime Outlets Hagerstown boasts over 100 stores and draws people from neighboring counties as well as Baltimore and Washington, D.C. The county also has several malls and other shopping centers drawing people from neighboring communities in Western Maryland, Southern Pennsylvania, and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nInterstates 81, 70, and 68 cross through the county as well as U.S. Routes 11, 40, Alternate 40, Scenic 40, 340, and 522.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nGreyhound ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.greyhound.com\/"]}," and Atlantic Coast Charter Buses ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.trailways.com\/Default.aspx?alias=www.trailways.com\/atlanticcoasttrailways"]}," both have stops in Hagerstown.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hagerstown Regional Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["HGR"]]},") has flights to and from Orlando-Sanford International Airport and Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
