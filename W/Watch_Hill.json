Situated on a peninsula that stretches out into Block Island sound, Watch Hill forms with Napatree Point to create ‘little Narragansett Bay’. This small bay offers excellent protection from strong currents, and provides a harbor where many sailboats and yachts moor and dock. On clear days, both Fishers Island and Long Island NY, can be seen to the South of Napatree Point. Watch Hill was occupied in the seventeenth century by the Nianticks, a part of the Narragansett Native American tribe. The area we now call Watch Hill was used as a watch point in the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War by Europeans.  This is how Watch Hill got its name! In fact, Napatree Point was once used as a military installation by the U.S. Military, and an abandoned cement fort can be found at the end of Napatree. In 1882 the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations purchased Watch Hill from the remaining Nianticks for $5,000. In 1901, Watch Hill was authorized as a fire-district, therefore, residents of Watch Hill fund their own volunteer department. However, non-fire related taxes are paid to the town of Westerly, because Watch Hill is a Westerly village.  Primarily, a summer vacation area, due to the pristine beaches, Watch Hill is known for its mansions. At one time, the most expensive residential home was located off of Yosemite Valley Road in Watch Hill. Aside from the breathtaking scenery, Watch Hill was once a hideout for Albert Einstein and Isadora Duncan.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Westerly Airport"]},", 56 Airport Road, +1 401 596-2357, Even though it does have its own airport code, don't expect flights to leave from this airport to leave for big cities like Las Vegas any time soon.

The original lighthouse was operational through the French and Indian war, and it is believed that the main tower was destroyed in a storm in 1781. The 35 foot tall light tower was rebuilt as an order of congress and its operation began again in 1808. By the 1850s much of the wooden structure of both the lighthouse and innkeepers residence were rotting away. It was decided that repairs of the old lighthouse would be too expensive, so the current lighthouse was constructed in 1856. The new structure is built of granite and brick. The light keeper’s house now contains 3 bedrooms, a sitting room, a dining room, a kitchen, a maintenance room and a cellar. The lighthouse has survived many storms including the Great New England Hurricane of September 21st, 1938 where waves were breaking over the top of the tower. The lighthouse was automated in 1986 and now serves as a museum. It can be found on the National Register of Historic Places.\nAdditional Lighthouse information: The station is open to the public year round, and offers great views of the ocean and Fishers Sound. A museum located in the fog signal building contains the fourth-order Fresnel lens used in the tower, but it is only open during the summer months.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Watch Hill Yacht Club"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=1 Ford Road"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 401 596-4986"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This is an exclusive club, but you can definitely take a walk along the water to look at all the beautiful yachts docked there.

Back around 1876, the Charles W. Dare Company, a traveling carnival, came and built the Merry-Go-Round and around 1879, the traveling carnival company left, leaving the Merry-Go-Round as a gift to the village of Watch Hill.  Over 100 years later the Merry-Go-Round is considered a United States Historic landmark and is on the United States National historic register of historic places. The Merry-Go-Round  is located on the bend of Bay Street, under a wooden gazebo that has big, stone columns. Inside of the gazebo is the Merry-Go-Round. The reason why this Merry-Go-Round is called the flying horse Merry-Go-Round is because horses are suspended by chains and not fastened to poles, so when the Merry-Go-Round spins, it appears that the children are flying on horses through the air. There are two rows of horses; a set of smaller horses in the inside and a set of larger horses on the outside. All of the horses were carved by hand out of a single piece of wood. The horses are simple, complete with a cracked leather saddle, reins, mane and tail. Each winter the horses are stored and restored after the exposure to the summer weather. The horses’ manes were real horsehair. Legend has it that back in 1879 when the Merry-Go-Round was permanently placed in Watch Hill, the horse of the caravan when he died, his mane was placed into one of the horses. The eyes of the horses are the original agate eyes from 1879."]},"\tIn 1993, a local woodcarver named Gary Anderson from Pawcatuck, CT, cleaned the horses of fifty years worth of paint. Upon stripping the horses from the paint, he uncovered horses are actually hollow, like rocking horses. From, 1993 on, the Watch Hill Improvement Society has worked hard to keep the Merry-Go-Round's appearance pristine. \tAside from the Merry-Go-Round's beauty the one thing that attracts many children to the horses is the brass ring game. Riding on the outside horses, youngsters can reach out and grab rings and collect them on the horse’s ears. However, there is one special ring, the brass ring, and to the person who attains it, they get a free ride on the Merry-Go-Round.\n\tThe Flying Horse Merry-Go-Round is a staple of the Watch Hill village and is also the inspiration behind two children’s books: The Brass Ring by Nancy Tafuri and The Flying Horses by Lynn Anderson. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Watch Hill Beach"]},"  You have to pay to use this beach.

Napatree Point is an official Conservation Area, protecting endangered species that inhabit the dunes, such as the Roaseate Tern, Piping Plover, Osprey, and American Beach grass.  Be aware that no dogs are allowed on this beach May 2 through Labor Day, from 8AM - 6PM  This rule is strictly enforced by beach patrol.  After Labor Day, however, leashed dogs are allowed on the beach.  Napatree is great for a casual jog--the length of the strip is about 1 mile.Napatree Point is the long stretch of beach and dune grass that help form ‘little Narragansett Bay’.  The long stretch of beach is approximately 1.5 miles long. The term Napatree can be broken down into ‘nap’ (neck) of trees. The point was heavily wooded until 1815, when a large hurricane came and wiped out the trees. At the end of the point is Fort Mansfield, an abandoned military fort. It was built as part of several other forts on the Atlantic coast to protect New York City. Fort Mansfield was operational 1901 to 1909, then in 1926 the land was sold, and the military deserted the fort. In 1926, residential homes were built on the beach. When the Hurricane of 1938 came, the hurricane decimated the properties on the point, including the road that ran along the point. Only 15 out of the 42 people who were in their homes when the hurricane struck died.  Presently, there are no homes or roads on the point. Napatree Point is a nature preserves that is an excellent place to bird watch, collect seashells, swim, walk, or enjoy nature. Parts of the beach are closed in the spring, so the Piping Plover Birds’ nests are not disturbed; after all piping plovers are federally endangered. Napatree point is also home to ospreys. The Watch Hill Conservancy works with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the plovers and the rest of the wildlife.
