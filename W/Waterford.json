Located on the River Suir, Waterford was once one of the most important European ports in times past. Today, Waterford still maintains its 'small Irish town' feel, and has a much more relaxed vibe than the larger cities, whilst still providing for most traveler's tastes. Appealing most, perhaps, to interests including history, culture, music and arts. Waterford, like most Irish towns, has a lot of pubs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\nWaterford is in the south-east of Ireland on the River Suir, and close to where the Suir, Barrow and Nore enter into the sea. Most of Waterford City itself is on the southern side of the river, Ferrybank being the only suburb on the north. The South Quay (once dubbed 'The Noblest Quay in Europe') is a mile long and provides the perfect entrance to the city.\n\nBeing a medieval town, the city itself has sprawled over other fully functional villages over the many generations of its existence. Most (if not all) of these villages have kept their own village centres and attitudes,which provides the city with numerous cultural quarters. The oldest of these is the Viking triangle near Reginald's tower. Narrow lanes, tranquil surroundings and late-night dining have made this spot very popular with visitors. The architecture in the area is also some of the finest in the city.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Waterfordcathedral.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Barronstrand Street, Waterford"]]},"\nAfter a Norman conquest, as Waterford grew, the city walls were extended west. A large portion of these walls still stand today, and tours are run regularly. Inside the Norman quarter (opposite the Clock Tower on the Quay) is the pedestrianised John Roberts Square, and Arundel Square. These are two of the main social and commercial hubs in the city. \n\nJust outside the walls is Ballybricken, one of the many inner-city villages in Waterford. The centre has been converted into a public green area with a bandstand and many benches for those tired from walking the hill. Being an old farmers community, Ballybricken is known locally for having some of the finest produce and butcher shops in the city. Waterford city Garda station is also located on Ballybricken.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["When to visit"]},"\nWaterford has a wet and windy climate like most of Ireland almost all year round. The summers are mild, but absolutely no guarantee of good weather. Heavy rain is common in the Winter, and snow is rare.
