From either of these stations it is a 3-kilometre walk to the site. The most convenient way to get to Waterloo from Brussels is the hourly bus to Charleroi operated by TEC. It starts at Brussel-Zuid\/Midi station and, after about half an hour, has a stop that is just 300 metres away from the Lion's Mound.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Waterloo Battlefield, Lion's Mound"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.waterloo1815.be\/en\/waterloo\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Discover the Waterloo Battlefield where Napoleon lost his final battle.

The Lion's Mound is an artificial hill of 43 metres high with a statue of a lion on top, roaring southwards in the direction of France. It can be climbed by stairs and offers a splendid view over the whole battlefield. If you are coming from Germany and exit the highway at Waterloo exit, do not expect to find large road signs or anybody in Waterloo streets to indicate where the battlefield is (\"Alesia?
