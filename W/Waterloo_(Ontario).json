Technology companies thrive due to the convenience of the University of Waterloo, which boasts the largest math and computer science undergraduate program in the world. The university is also very famous for its psychology program. Waterloo pioneered the concept of university co-op where students alternate terms of study with terms of paid work experience. Today it boasts the largest co-op undergraduate enrolment in the world.\n\nWaterloo was once known as the \"Hartford of Canada\" due to the large number of insurance companies that once had their headquarters here.  Insurance is still a major industry in Waterloo due to the presence of Manulife Financial and Sun Life Financial.\n\nFarmland is quite close outside the city limits, and many Mennonites live close by. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. Jacobs (Ontario)"],["St. Jacobs"]]}," is a small  village immediately to the north of the city, with markets and stores that have come to be very popular.\n\nThe city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kitchener"]]}," is located immediately to the south of Waterloo.  These two cities, often referred together as \"Kitchener-Waterloo\" (abbreviated to \"K-W\"), are separate municipalities, but share a long, seamless border.  If visiting Waterloo, take Kitchener's attractions into consideration as well.  Waterloo's central business district is referred to as \"Uptown\", in contrast to Kitchener's, which is referred to as \"Downtown\".  Note, however, that Uptown Waterloo is not particularly large compared to neighbouring cities' downtowns; Waterloo is essentially a suburban city.  The distributed nature of the city does mean that Uptown Waterloo has maintained a small-town atmosphere (for now; plans to intensify the Uptown are afoot).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrom Highway 401, take exit 278 (if coming from the west) or 278A (if coming from the east).

Other routes that connect Kitchener to Waterloo are routes 7 (runs along King Street), 8 (runs in a loop along Westmount Road, University Avenue, and Weber Street) and 12 (runs along Fischer-Hallman Road, Keats Way, and University Avenue, then through suburbs in eastern Waterloo).  All four routes serve the two universities and (except for route 8) Conestoga Mall, and Uptown is served by the iXpress and route 7.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nRegion of Waterloo International Airport (YKF) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.waterlooairport.ca\/"]}," is serviced by a limited number of airlines.

Regular rush hour service is available on weekdays between Kitchener and Toronto, with reduced service on weekends. As the station is closed between 1PM and 5PM (between train arrivals), guests may not always find the ticket counter open and should consider booking online.  To reach Waterloo from Kitchener station, the easiest option is to take a cab (there are usually some to be found at the station around train time); cheaper options involve walking two blocks, either westward to King Street or eastward to Margaret Avenue, and catching a route 7 or 8 bus, or even walking north along Weber Street (Waterloo's city limits are a 15-minute walk to the north).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nUnlike a metropolis such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toronto"]]},", it is relatively quick and easy to get from one point to another by car because the distances aren't far, and the traffic isn't too busy.  Looking at a map of Kitchener-Waterloo, one of the first things visitors from other parts of Ontario will notice is that, far from forming a grid pattern, the streets are not straight, curving and wiggling in surprising patterns.  For example, there are two streets, King and Weber, which are parallel for most of their length, but cross each other 3 times in K-W.  The irregular road pattern dates to the earliest settlement in K-W; unlike most Ontario townships, whose roads were laid out in a grid pattern, Waterloo Township was laid out without road allowances, allowing settlers to build roads where they were needed.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["King Street"]}," is the main street that travels roughly North-South through the downtown of Kitchener and Waterloo.  In Waterloo, it is labelled King St. North and South, with the transition at Erb Street (in Kitchener, it is labelled King St. East and West).\n\nGrand River Transit is the transit authority for the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Region of Waterloo (Ontario)"],["Region of Waterloo"]]},".  Students at the two universities have a GRT bus pass included in their student fees and so, many of the bus riders in Waterloo are students.  Therefore, the main routes in Waterloo are those that run near the universities, namely the 7, 8, 12, and iXpress, described above, and the route 9, which travels between Conestoga Mall and the two universities via the Lakeshore subdivision.  These routes offer 15 minute service during the day, at least at peak times, and 30 minute service on evenings until around 1AM and on Saturdays and Sundays.  These routes are probably the only ones a casual traveller needs to take, as together they run near most of the city's attractions, hotels, shopping centres, etc.  There are several other routes, which generally serve outlying subdivisions, but most of them have 30 minute service on weekdays, reduced evening and Saturday service, no Sunday service, and not-always-convenient connections.  Bus schedules are available at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/transit.nsf\/form?OpenForm "]},"; alternatively, you can acquire them piecemeal on buses, or all at once at either of the universities.\n\nThere are three taxi companies that serve Waterloo and the surrounding area:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Waterloo Taxi (519-886-1200)"]},{"type":"*","value":["United Taxi (519-888-9999)"]},{"type":"*","value":["City Cabs (519-747-7777)"]},"\nWaterloo is reasonably bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly, so travelling by bicycle or on foot is reasonable for shorter trips.
