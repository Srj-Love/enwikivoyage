Iron ore (hematite) was found in 1897; the last of the mines closed a century later. Forestry was also once a major local industry, but is in decline in the Wawa, Dubreuilville and White River region as Weyerhauser closed its oriented strandboard mill in 2007. The local population, close to 6000 at its 1990s peak, has dropped by half in about twenty years; portions of the town and highway were damaged by a flood in 2012.\n\nThe last Ontario section of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trans-Canada Highway"]]},", 250km (150 miles) from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sault Ste.
