Among the 60 original men, women, and children, were 15 Puritan families who had traveled in the ship Confidence from England. Bringing with them the English pattern of farming, with collective fields and grazing along with individual lots, they named their town Sudbury after the town in Suffolk, where their pastor Edmund Brown and some of their company had lived. The original settlement was clustered one half mile northwest of where the town center is now located. Wayland and Sudbury residents established the Sudbury Valley Trust in 1953 in part to protect these lands. Today Wayland is in the top 5 communities in the state in conservation acreage.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["East Sudbury 1780-1835, renamed Wayland in 1835"]},"\nThe first US census in 1790 showed that East Sudbury was a farming community of 801 people in 112 houses. Today’s Boston Post Road ran through it on the way to Albany. Travelers stopped at the Corner Tavern where Old Connecticut Path split off down to Hartford, near today’s Old Coach Grill. The Pequod Inn stood at the intersection of the Post Road and the roads north to western Sudbury and Concord. Baldwin ’s tavern was near the four arch bridge over the river. The First Parish Church was built in 1815, complete with a bell by Paul Revere.\n\nIn 1835, the men attending a town meeting voted to change the name East Sudbury to Wayland, to honor Rev. Francis Wayland, President of Brown University, who was a friend of Judge Edward Mellen (whose law offices are found in the Wayland Historic District in a small white house at the intersection of Boston Post Road and Old Sudbury Road).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nLogan International Airport is the closest airport to Wayland and has many flights every day from anywhere you can think of.

And US-20 runs through the southern part of town connecting Wayland to Natick and Framingham. You can also get to Wayland by taking the Mass Pike West from Boston and I-95 also has two exits (23-24-25 and 26) which bring you to either the southern or northern part of town.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nYou can take the Amtrak train to Westborough route 128 station and then get on I-95 north to Wayland.
