The iconic New York City skyline can be seen from almost street in town, perched as ot at the southern end of the Hudson Palisades. Also atop the cliffs is the memorial to Alexander Hamilton, who in 1804 was fatally wounded by Aaron Burr, then Vice-president of USA in the nation's most famous duel. From the right perspective one can see south to the Verranzo Narrows bridge and north to the George Washington Bridge. Also seen is many spots is the Weehawken Water Tower. The oldest in the state, the red brick tower from 1884 was inspired by the Plaza del Vecchio in Italy, and still serves as marker for those navigating the river. The entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel, the helix which descends to the toll plaza were designed and engineered during the Art Deco era.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nWhile mostly residential there are a few restaurants in town, including two upscale places, The Chart House, and Author's Landing, at the river's edge.
