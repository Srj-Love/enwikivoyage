It's most famous as a wintering ground for the Black-necked crane.  Wintering birds begin to arrive in late October.  Narrow boats paddled by local farmers can be hired near the lake's main entrance.  Rates are standard and posted, beginning at ¥120\/hour.  The Preserve police recently began to enforce those rates more tightly, but some guidebooks have noted that tourists may have trouble securing the posted rate.
