[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Weizhou Island Beach Panorama.JPG"],["thumb"],["Panoramic view from a Weizhou Island Beach"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Weizhou"]}," (涠洲岛; Wéizhōu Dǎo) is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},"'s biggest and youngest volcanic island. It is located 21 nautical miles south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beihai"]]}," city in the Gulf of Tonkin, an arm of the South China Sea. With about 6km from north to south and 5km from east to west, the island covers a land area of about 25km².\n\nWeizhou Island is declared as national park. The admission fee is ¥90 (¥65 in winter's off-season) and must be paid while entering the island at the harbour (XiJiao MaTou). The entrance ticket covers the whole island and is valid for the entire stay.\n\nFormed by volcanic eruptions about 7,000 years ago Weizhou Island has a unique geological and geomorphologic landscape. The sea around Weizhou is rich in corals and other aquatic animals. Its subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 22.6°C and an annual average rainfall of about 1380mm causes moderate summers and mild winters.\n\nExcept for Chinese national holidays Weizhou Island is not heavily touristed. Chinese tourists come here on daily trips and over weekends, but rarely stay longer. The island offers various scenic spots, a Gothic-style catholic cathedral, good and inexpensive seafood and wide beautiful beaches. It is ideal for relaxing and having a rest. Even the nightlife on Weizhou is less revelry than having a good time in one of its bars located in South Bay (NanWan) or a nice BBQ while enjoying the summer breeze from the sea. \n\nIf you travel with foreign bank cards, bring enough cash for your entire stay on the island. The only ATM on the island (in NanWan) will accept Chinese bank cards only and the local bank branch does not exchange foreign money either.\n\nWhen planning a trip to Weizhou the weather forecast should be checked in advance. During heavy sea Weizhou Island can neither be reached nor left due to no ferries driving.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nEnglish is not widespread on Weizhou. As English is a school subject younger local people and children will be pleased to have a little English chat with foreign visitors.

The ticket counter closes 15 minutes before departure, and due to possible lengthy ticket queues it is advisable to arrive with plenty of time to spare.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe island has an impressive fleet of motor tricycles (¥5-30 per trip, ¥100 to hire for the day). The tricycle drivers rarely speak English. For exploring the island on one's own, motor scooters (¥120\/day), e-bikes (¥80\/day) and bicycles (from ¥20\/day for city bikes up to ¥60\/day for mountain bikes) can be rented as well. The deposit for renting is between ¥200 and ¥300.
