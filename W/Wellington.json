Wellington’s charm is that it serves up a vibrant inner city experience with a slice of New Zealand scenery. And because of its compact nature, you can sample it all: boutiques, art galleries, trendy cafés and restaurants. Right on its doorstep is a network of walking and biking trails with beautiful wineries and vineyards just a few hours away.\n\nWellington offers an array of theatre, music, dance, fine arts and galleries and museums. It is also home to one of the nation’s key attractions, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.\n\nThe city promotes itself as \"Absolutely Positively Wellington\". Its motto ",{"type":"''","value":["Suprema a situ"]}," claims site supremacy, with some justification.

This is especially true in the areas closest to Parliament Buildings - the northern end of The Terrace and Lambton Quay areas and the Thorndon commercial area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geology"]},"\nMuch of the central city is built on land that was raised up after a major earthquake in 1855. More land has been reclaimed since then. The shoreline as it was in 1840 is marked by plaques in the footpaths on Lambton Quay (hence the street name). There are several \"quays\" which are now nowhere near the harbour. The harbour's former name was 'Port Nicholson' and the smaller bay surrounded by the city is called 'Wellington' or 'Lambton Harbour'.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Earthquakes"]}," have played a major part in forming the whole Wellington region, the exposed face of the Wellington fault being prominent as the line of hills adjacent to the harbour between Thorndon and Petone. There are several major earthquake faults in the region, some of which slip one metre  or more in one jump every few centuries. Building regulations have meant that many older city buildings have been either demolished or strengthened, or require such work to be undertaken. Small and moderate earthquakes occasionally rock Wellington; so if the earth seems to move for you, it may not be just your imagination: stay indoors unless a \"warden\" or similar authority advises evacuation, and take shelter from potentially falling objects wherever you are.\n\nThere are some places in Wellington where damage from the 1855 earthquake is still visible. The most accessible is a large landslip on State Highway 2 between Ngauranga and Korokoro (just north of Rocky Point where the BP petrol station is located) where the dramatic change in terrain is visible. Bush has overgrown the slip but is visible. However, most people are oblivious to the location of landslip as they drive by on the highway.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe city is known as \"Windy Wellington\". The prevailing wind is from the northwest but the strongest winds are southerly. The wind speed and direction can be seen by the flag being flown from ",{"type":"''","value":["the Beehive"]},". A large flag is flown only on calm days, a small flag is flown when windy days are expected.\n\nThe temperature in Wellington rarely drops to 0°C (32°F), even on cold winter nights, while daytime winter temperatures are rarely lower than 8°C (46°F). During summer, the daytime maximum temperature rarely gets above 25°C (77°F). Away from the seaside, in inland valleys, frosts of up to -10°C (14°F) have been recorded and snow settles on the nearby ranges in winter.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nWellington sits at the southern tip of New Zealand's North Island.  The city core lies along the western shore of highly protected Wellington Harbour, with the city's suburbs spreading out in all directions.  The city's primary urban core consists of the ",{"type":"<","value":["abbr",{"title":"Central Business District"},["CBD"]]}," and the adjoining 'city suburb' of Te Aro, to the south and east.  A fairly dense zone continues south from Te Aro into the adjoining suburbs of Mt Cook and Newtown, as well as Kilbirnie on the other side of the parklands of Mt Victoria.\n\nEast from Te Aro, north-south-running ridgelines form Mt. Victoria and, further east yet, the Miramar Peninsula, which forms the western side of the mouth to Wellington Harbour. These hills—and the isthmus between—are home to a number of suburban areas as well as parkland and beaches.\n\nSeveral kilometres south of central Wellington is the rugged and stunning ",{"type":"''","value":["South Coast"]}," of the North Island, consisting of a string of small (and some large) bays, many with rocky beaches and interesting tide pools.\n\nTo the west, the suburbs between Karori and Johnsonville spread into the hillsides, with various parks and hiking trails, and then give way to open rural areas such as Makara.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Holidays"]},"\nAside from the national public holidays, Wellington has its own public holiday, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wellington Anniversary Day"]},". Commemorating the arrival of Wellington's first European settlers aboard the ",{"type":"''","value":["Aurora"]}," on 22 January 1840, it is observed across most of the Greater Wellington and Manawatu-Wanganui region on the Monday closest to 22 January.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Wellington Airport - Flickr - 111 Emergency (2).jpg"],["thumb"],["A Qantas Boeing 737 at Wellington International Airport"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wellington-airport.co.nz\/ Wellington International Airport"]}]}," is in Rongotai, about 5 km (3 mi) from the central city.  It sits on an isthmus between the Miramar peninsula and Mount Victoria.  The southerly approach is over Cook Strait, while the northerly approach is over the harbour.\n\nWellington airport is a major transit point for domestic travellers. There are frequent flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Auckland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Christchurch"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Palmerston North"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rotorua"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hamilton (New Zealand)"],["Hamilton"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nelson (New Zealand)"],["Nelson"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blenheim (New Zealand)"],["Blenheim"]]}," and many other destinations.  International flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]}," (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melbourne"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brisbane"]]},") arrive about twice daily: the evening flights arrive after midnight when most facilities are closed. There are also seasonal flights between Wellington and Fiji.\n\nLanding at Wellington Airport in a strong wind can be an adventure, and most pilots adopt a powered approach, followed by a full reverse thrust and hard braked landing due to the shortness of the runway (2,081 m). This tends to create a roller-coaster ride, so make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened. Many locals swap stories of approaches with large dips, shudders, bumps, sudden sideways movement, followed by the plane going around for a second (and even sometimes a third) attempt to land. Only pilots with a special license may fly commercial flights to Wellington, and while there have been a few near misses, no large passenger plane has ever had a serious crash in Wellington.\n\nThere is a regular airport bus known as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Flyer"]}," that departs from the south end of the domestic terminal until 21:00. Shuttle van services, taxis and covered car parking are directly outside the terminal.\n\nWhen you get to the airport, call the Metlink hotline at 0800 801700.  They answer very quickly and a friendly person will tell you what bus to take and even what special pass to buy (for example, if after the \"Flyer\" you are taking a train) if you say where you are going.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nThere are regular ferries between Wellington and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Picton (New Zealand)"],["Picton"]]}," operated by Interislander and Bluebridge, connecting with buses and the train to Christchurch. Cruise ships from overseas often stop in Wellington. The Interislander ferry terminal is located about 2 km (1 mi) northeast of the railway station, and a $2 shuttle bus runs between it and the railway station (bus terminal next to Platform 9). The Bluebridge ferry terminal, meanwhile, is located next to the railway station.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\nThere are only two major roads into Wellington: State Highways 1 & 2.  State Highway One follows the western coast to the north, and State Highway two heads north-east through the Hutt Valley, over the Rimutaka Ranges to the Wairarapa.  Both roads are initially motorway-standard, but quickly reduce to four-lane highways with traffic light-controlled intersection and then to two-lane undivided roads as they negotiate difficult terrain. While local authorities are working on improvements, serious and fatal crashes are common on these roads: remember to keep left, maintain a reasonable speed, and use the passing bays to overtake slower traffic.\n\nDrivers using the Rimutaka Hill road must be alert to extreme wind and weather, especially in winter. The road can close several times a year due to snowfall near the summit. Also drive carefully when descending as crashes have occurred where vehicles brakes have overheated and drivers have been unable to slow for sharp corners.\n\nHitchhiking from central Wellington is difficult as most traffic stays within the metropolitan area, and it is illegal to hitchhike on the motorway until the Hutt Valley (about 15 km or 9 mi northeast of Wellington) or Paremata (about 20 km or 12 mi north). If intending to hitchhike, you are best to catch a train to Waikanae or Upper Hutt and walk to the main highways to catch a lift from there (The best spot for Upper Hutt hitchhikers is at the Caltex petrol station about a 3 km walk north from the railway station along Fergusson Drive). Using a sign will help in finding a willing driver going your way.\n\nBe aware that a few hitchhikers, including tourists, have been attacked or murdered in New Zealand. While usually no problems occur, always be aware, and try to travel in pairs to reduce your risk.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThere is a train service between Wellington and Auckland.

Look for \"Flatmates wanted\" in the local Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday newspaper (Dominion Post) classifieds.\n\nFlats are much cheaper and usually well furnished already by the other tenants in the communal rooms. You may need to provide your own bed (you could buy a cheap one second hand for the summer), or they might be able lend you one.

Taking simple steps like locking valuables away and keeping to well-lit areas at night usually prevent problems.\n\nVehicle break-ins are common, especially in shopping malls and 'park and ride' type car parks. Thieves generally target older vehicles with less complicated locks. Removing all valuables and leaving the glove box open (to show that no valuables are hidden) will usually act as a deterrent.
