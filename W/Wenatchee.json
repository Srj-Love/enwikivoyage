It’s climate is very similar to that of other eastern Washington cities, yet it still retains the picturesque views of the Cascade mountains.\n\nIt is believe by archeologists that an ancient people had migrated to the Wenatchee area during the last ice, some 12,000 years ago. This belief is based on many Clovis artifacts that have been found in or around the greater Wenatchee. These ancient people are thought to be the descendants of whom would later become known as the Yakima Indians. White settlers began to move into the area during the late 1800’s and early 1900’s and colonization began.\n\nThe Wenatchee Valley provides an ideal climate for agricultural, and therefore, the area has become widely known for its produce. There are a plethora of orchards in the valley, especially Apple orchards, from which Wenatchee has earned the slogan “Apple Capital of the World.”\n\nIn recent years, the city has seen substantial growth within its communities. The greater Wenatchee area incorporates East Wenatchee, which lies on the opposite side of the Columbia River, as well as Rock Island and Malaga. The greater area has a population estimated at over 100,000 residents. It is a popular destination for outdoor adventurers and enthusiasts looking to find a refreshing getaway from their every day surroundings.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Pangborn Memorial Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["EAT"]]},") is the closest airport to Wenatchee (15 minutes away).
