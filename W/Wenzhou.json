Famed for its businessmen and women of the night (and the ",{"type":"''","value":["Wenzhou model"]}," of business), Wenzhou is frequently used by Western media as a barometer of the Chinese export economy; among other things, Wenzhou manufactures around 90% of the world's spectacles and massive quantities of shoes. Wenzhou is not on many China tour itineraries and despite being a Chinese cultural hotpot, it is not the most foreigner friendly of cities (compared with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hangzhou"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ningbo"]]},", for example). However, there are plenty of things to do and see should you find yourself with time on your hands in Wenzhou. The city has a resident foreigner community that is below average for the city's size (100-200), although foreign businessmen often pass through.\n\nAlthough Mandarin is widely spoken, the local dialect is Wenzhounese (温州话; Wēnzhōuhuà) and is regarded by Chinese nationals as one of the most difficult dialects in the country, so much so that Wenzhounese speakers were used by the Chinese resistance in World War II to communicate under the nose of the Japanese. Wenzhounese people populate many of the China towns around the globe (where their language is still spoken) and own the leases to many properties in Beijing and even San Francisco.\n\nWenzhou is near the East China Sea (called East Ocean in Chinese) in the south-eastern part of China. It is a prosperous city with a rapid economic boom because Wenzhou was one of the first port cities to be opened to foreign trade after Deng Xiaoping took over China in the 1970s. Wenzhou is the biggest and most prosperous city in the south of Zhejiang Province, and considers the importance of education highly. Hence, many famous mathematicians have come from this city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Weather"]},"\nWenzhou is a city with frequent rains, and the average annual temperature is around 17 degrees.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nWenzhou Airport is east of the city. It receives flights from around China, and because it also supports flights to and from Hong Kong, it is considered international. Wenzhou Airport recently built a new terminal which is much more user friendly and less oppressive for foreigners.\n\nYou can get from the airport to the city center by taxi or bus.

If a taxi driver offers you a ride under ¥100 it can be regarded as a good deal. Taking the bus is now much easier due to a ticket desk in the new terminal opposite the exit gate. The bus costs ¥12 and drives through New City (新城; Xīnchéng), Xialüpu (下吕浦; Xiàlǚpǔ) and finally stops at a depot on Nanpu Road (南浦路; Nánpǔlù).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nWenzhou Central Train Station serves most cities throughout China, although because of Wenzhou's mountains, train journeys are sometimes much longer than their bus counterparts.

The bus stop sign also lists the stops on one side and shows a map on the other.

If you are outside the centre of the city, or in the centre trying to get elsewhere, you will not be able to catch a taxi between 4:30PM and 6PM. This is because of the driver shift change. If you are taking a longer-distance ride or travelling during rush hour, expect to \"share\" your taxi ride with others going to same section of the city (and pay more about ¥15 plus ¥2 tax for longer rides).\n\nWatch out for prices charged by taxi drivers \"off the meter\" and negotiate price if it is raining, or during rush hour, prior to your ride.
