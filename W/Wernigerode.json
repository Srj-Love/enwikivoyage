It was during that time, in 1229, that it was granted town rights. Wernigerode's heyday came during the 14th and 15th centuries as it grew wealthy through trading in cloth, beer and brandy. However, it suffered from plague epidemics in the 16th century as well as the ravages of the Thirty Years' War and fell into decline. \n\nFrom 1645 to 1807, Wernigerode became the seat of the County of Stolberg-Wernigerode. At the end of the 18th century, the town's economy picked up again, this time based on tanning and the manufacture of cloth and linen. In 1815 it was absorbed into the Prussian Province of Saxony. The industrial revolution saw new metal and wood industries settling here. The railways arrived in 1872, the same year that the Harz's best known brewery, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Hasseröder Brauerei"]},", was founded.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Wernigerode fell on the East German side of the Inner German Border in the newly-created state Saxony-Anhalt. Wernigerode became part of the restored state of Saxony-Anhalt in 1990 after German reunification and did not take long to restore the beauty of its timber-framed town houses. \n\nIn 2004 Wernigerode celebrated the 775th anniversary of being granted town rights.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By road "]},"\nWernigerode has two junctions (Wernigerode-Nord and Wernigerode-Zentrum) on the B 6, a motorway-like dual carriageway that runs along the northern edge of the Harz from west to east.
