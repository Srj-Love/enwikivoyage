It includes the whole of the Prapat Agung Peninsula, and large swathes of land around the towns of Gilimanuk, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cekik"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Banyuwedang"]},". The official area inside the park boundaries is 190 square kilometres, with a further 580 square kilometres of protected reserve in the highlands to the east. In total this accounts for some ten percent of Bali's total land area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe park was first officially recognised as an area of importance in 1917 when the council of Bali rulers designated it as a ",{"type":"''","value":["nature park"]},". It was fully established as an Indonesian National Park in 1941.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThe habitat is very varied with rainforest, dry savanna, acacia scrub and lowland forests, as well as more montane forests in the higher centre. There are also some pockets of dense mangrove forest.\n\nIn the north of the park there is an obvious north jutting peninsula called Prapat Agung. Around this peninsula there are long stretches of protected beach and offshore coral reef as well, as a small offshore island called Menjangan. The latter is a very popular diving destination.\n\nThere are several long extinct volcanoes in the protected reserve area to the east, with Mount Patas (1,412 metres) and Mount Merbuk (1,388 metres) being the highest points. These peaks are dominant visual landscape features from within every area of the park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Stavenn Leucopsar rothschildi 00.jpg‎"],["thumb"],["right"],["150px"],["Bali Starling"]]},"\n\nOne hundred and sixty species of bird have been recorded in the park, including the near extinct Bali Starling, Bali's only endemic vertebrate species, and a key reason why this national park was created in the first place. By 2001, as few as six individuals were thought to survive in the wild, all of them in this park. Since then captive breeding and re-introduction efforts have continued apace, but poaching pressures are a large problem. With that in mind, a seconf re-introduction programme was started in remote regions of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nusa Penida"]]}," in 2004. Keen birdwatchers can find a checklist of likely species and their status here ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.birdlist.org\/sas\/Indonesia\/bali.htm"]},".\n\nMammals found inside the park include Banteng, a species of wild cattle from which the familiar Bali cows are descended. Java Rusa and Indian Muntjac deer are quite widespread, and Menjangan Island is in fact named after these (Menjangan means deer in Bahasa Indonesia). Wild Boar and Leopard Cats are both quite common but seldom encoutered.\n\nA Bali Tiger (a full sub-species of Tiger) was shot here in 1937, and despite rumours to the contrary, that is the last ever confirmed sighting of an animal considered extinct since that moment.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nNot noticeably different from the rest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bali"]]}," or eastern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Java"]]},", but it may feel a little hotter and drier in the dry season here than in southern parts of Bali.\n\nBali is always warm, humid and tropical, remaining around 30-35°C (85-95°F) all year round. The April–October dry season and November–March rainy seasons are only relative, with plenty of rainfall around the year, but the Balinese winter is cloudier, more humid and with a higher chance of thunderstorms.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Bali Barat National Park Office HQ"],["url=http:\/\/www.tnbalibarat.com\/"],["email=tnbb@telkom.net"],["address=Jl Raya Cekik-Gilimanuk, Jembrana, Bali 82253"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+62 365 61060"],["tollfree="],["fax=+62 365 61479"],["hours=7:30AM-5PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Bali Barat National Park Vistor's Centre"],["url=http:\/\/www.tnbalibarat.com\/"],["email=tnbb@telkom.net"],["address=Labuhan Lalang"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=7:30AM-5PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Bali-West-Bali-National-Park-Map.png"],["right"],["thumb"],["500px"],["Map of West Bali National Park"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMost visitors to the park arrive along the north coast road from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lovina"]]}," (about 90 minutes) or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pemuteran"]]}," (about 15 minutes).

There are two key ways to explore the park: either hiking the trails or concentrating on marine aspects.\n\nWalking the trails must be done with an official guide from one of the national park offices (most normally the one at Cekik).

This is tougher walking for about five hours, but it takes you through some memorable rainforest.

Ask guides about other opportunities at the time, particularly those involving hiking deeper into the Prapat Agung Peninsula.\n\nThe uninhabited ",{"type":"'''","value":["Menjangan Island"]}," is a must-do for any visitor to Bali interested in marine life, snorkelling or diving. Boats leave from the beach at Labuan Lalang at the northern edge of Teluk Terima bay, and can chartered on the day. Groups of tourists often club together at Labuan Lalang in the mornings for that very purpose. Any boat charter must be accompanied by a guide, and you must purchase a permit (Rp 25,000 per person) from the national park office in the main Labuhan Lalang car park. Many of Bali's dive operators based in the southern tourist regions offer dive excursions specifically to Menjangan.  The snorkelling here is probably the best on Bali with good clear water and calm seas.\n\nThere is a notable temple on Menjangan called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Puri Gili Kencana"]}," which is certainly worth a visit.
