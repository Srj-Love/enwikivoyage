The Milwaukee River meanders through on it's way to Lake Michigan.  The community has developed a bike trail, river walk, and a vibrant downtown.  It is a popular destination on warm Thursday nights to hear music and Saturday mornings for the Farmer's Market. There is also a taxi service in West Bend. Taxis have to be scheduled early to pick you up. They will almost always be very late however, so it is best to avoid the taxi service if at all possible.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Museum of Wisconsin Art"],["url=http:\/\/www.wisconsinart.org\/"],["email="],["address=300 South 6th Ave"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Admission is $5.00 for adults, $3.00 for senior citizens and students."],["content=Across the street from the Old courthouse and the Library.
