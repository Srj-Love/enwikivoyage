It has since seen a lot of turbulence. Anyone visiting the state should be aware of Begalis' preoccupation with strikes (bandh). When these occur, all transportation (except train) stops and so travel is impossible. Travellers flying from Kolkata need to take this situation into account and plan to arrive several days early.\n\nThe topography of the majority of West Bengal is flat, and as a major rice growing region it is characterised by its lush and green environment. However, with the notable exception of the towns located in the tea growing areas of Jalpaiguri (the area around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Siliguri"]]},") and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Darjeeling"]]},", the urban areas tend to be characterless jumbles of concrete boxes devoid of charm.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bengali"]]}," is the main language here. Apart from Bengali - English, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hindi"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Odia"]]}," (also known as Oriya) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Assamese"]]}," are also widely understood by the local people. In the Darjeeling area the main language is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nepali"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kolkata"]]}," is normally the gateway to the state but there are entry points all around. Two commercial airports are at Kolkata and Bagdogra. The state has a number of smaller airports. Railways link it with other states from all sides. Major road connections are NH 2 from Delhi, NH 5 from Chennai, NH 6 from western India and NH 31 from Guwahati. Major ports are Kolkata and Haldia. There are a number of smaller ports. Kolkata is also connected by the golden quadrangle that joins the four metropolitan cities of the country(Delhi,Kolkata,Mumbai,Chennai).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]}," \n\nWithin the state the main transport links are trains and buses. Apart from the mail and express trains coming from outside the state (they are generally very crowded), there are a number of fast trains within the state, large number of passenger trains and locals (mostly around Kolkata). Taxis and hired cars are available in most places.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]}," \n\nThe state stretches from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal and so there are many things to see. Some of the places of tourist interest are listed above. It has wonderful cultural heritage, particularly towards the rural sides. The northern side has beautiful hills and forests, while the south has some nice beaches.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]}," \nVisit sweets shops in Kolkata. Some of the sweets are unique.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]}," \n\nBengal is famous for fish preparations and sweet-meat but some of the vegetarian dishes are also a speciality. In earlier centuries widows were prohibited from taking anything other than vegetarian food (predominantly they still are but now rules are being broken) and they were principal chefs in large homes. They developed the vegetarian dishes extensively. \n\nIn a big city such as Kolkata one will get food as per choice of people from all over the country. Then one gets Chinese, Thai and continental. In most of the other towns it is Bengali cooking, plus Punjabi or North Indian preparations and some South Indian outlets. Mughlai dishes are popular. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]}," \n\nThere are plenty of bars across the state.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nWest Bengal is very safe for foreigners. There is hardly any incident of crime against foreigners in recent years. People are friendly and accept people of different cultures warmly. As a foreigner you might find people staring at you but they are just curious. But if you notice anything objectionable in their behaviour with you, face them boldly and ask for help. People are helpful and you will have them coming to your rescue. You may also call the police. They are reliable. \nThere are certain areas in West Bengal infested with Maoists insurgents and the State government along with the central forces is in a state of battle with them. These areas are mostly located to the south-west of West Bengal along its border with neighbouring state of Odisha (formerly Orissa) and Jharkhand. The areas include, district of Paschim Medinipur, parts of Purba Medinipur, Purulia and Bankura. These places though have rich tribal culture heritage, are not usually flocked by tourists. Those planning to visit must assess security situation prevailing at that time. Though the targets of the insurgents are mostly personnel of security forces, few attacks on civilians were also reported in the past. The incidence of Maoist violence has diminished recently but they continue to be a ruthless force. Apart from that the rest of West Bengal is very tourist friendly.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Eastern India"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["la:Bengala Occidentalis"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:West Bengal"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["22.566666666667"],["88.366666666667"]]}]
