The house is thought to have taken its name from an oak which stood on the green in front of it and was burnt down around 1800, though it could have been named after the oak woodland that once surrounded the house. Alderman Reuben Farley was one of the towns greatest benefactors. He purchased the Oak House with the intention of making it his private residence, but resolved to present it to the town as a museum. The leading architects in West Bromwich, Messrs. Wood and Kendrick, were employed with the task of restoring the house. Skilled craftsmanship ensured the outstanding quality of the restoration and the museum was formally opened on 25 July 1898; gardens and a bowling green were also laid out. To mark the fiftieth anniversary of the gift, the corporation decided to convert the Oak House into a period house with antique furnishings; the formal reopening took place in 1951."]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Budget"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Simma's Diner (aka Eljays)"],["url="],["email="],["address=13-15 Vicarage Road, West Bromwich, B71 1AN"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Turn off the A4031 (All Saints Way) near the hospital and continue down Wilford Road until you reach the row of shops."],["phone = +44 121 522 2861"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A traditional English cafe with a wide array of breakfasts and brunchs to suit most tastes.
