With just 3000 people living on an area of 3900 km² it is the least populated district of Suriname. It is very fruitful and famous for its coconut palms. Most people live on a thin strip along the coast to which the largest freshwater swamp of Suriname borders. Angling is very popular.

Another place of some importance is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wageningen"]},".\n\nThe main source of livelihood is rice cultivation and in addition fishing on the Corentyne River and Nickerie. Livestock is mainly cattle, but also sheep, goats, chickens and ",{"type":"''","value":["doksen"]}," (ducks) are cultivated. The population mainly exists of Hindus, but also Javanese, Chinese and Creoles live in the region.\n\nThe area consists of polders constructed during the Dutch colonization.

Be aware of speed bumps which are signed as ",{"type":"'''","value":["drempel"]},". These can be very high to force reducing your speed to nearly null. Most bumps are constructed as twins at the entrance and exit of communities and junctions. The road is not marked with traffic lines. Gas may not be a problem as these days more and more gas stations are opened.\n\nWageningen is about 50 km east of Nieuw Nickerie passing endless polders with paddies.
