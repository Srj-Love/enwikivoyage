West Frisian is the name by which this language is usually known outside of the Netherlands, to distinguish it from the closely related Frisian languages of Saterland Frisian and North Frisian, which are spoken in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]},". Within the Netherlands, however, (and often in other countries) the West Frisian language is the language of the province of Fryslân and is virtually always just called Frisian: ",{"type":"''","value":["Fries"]}," in Dutch, and ",{"type":"''","value":["Frysk"]}," in Frisian.

The province has 643,000 inhabitants (2005); of these, 94% can understand spoken Frisian, 74% can speak Frisian, 65% can read Frisian, and 17% can write it. For over half of the inhabitants of the province of Fryslân, 55% (c. 354,000 people), Frisian is the native tongue.\n\nTo find out more about West Frisian, including the history, visit Wikipedia",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/West_Frisian_language"]},".\n\nWest Frisian is similar in both sound and grammar to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dutch phrasebook"],["Dutch"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Afrikaans phrasebook"],["Afrikaans"]]}," and some northern dialects of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["German phrasebook"],["German"]]},".
