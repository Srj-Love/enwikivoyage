West Greenwich then separated from East Greenwich on April 6, 1741, making it officially its own town, only because of the efforts of freemen of this area. This divided West Greenwich, around 35,000 acres of land, from the empty land in the Narragansett country tract and ran to 13 residents of East Greenwich and Warwick.\n\nWest Greenwich was named for Greenwich, Kent, England.\n\nThe town hall is 102 feet long and it sits 102 feet from Route 102.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Stepping Stone Falls"],["url="],["email="],["address=Falls River Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 401-539-2356"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Great trails for walking and hiking.
