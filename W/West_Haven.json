Although it makes no pretentions to fine dining, the food is quite surprisingly tasty and there is a wide selection for a restaurant of this type.  On the menu are fried and grilled fish of all kinds, fried clam (strips or bellies), lobster rolls, clams on the half-shell, hot dogs, and more.  There is cramped indoor dining, shaded and unshaded picnic tables outside, or takeout is available.
