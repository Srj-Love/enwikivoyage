Oban was served by a separate line (called the Callander and Oban Railway) from Glasgow, which was opened in 1880.

It crosses the famous 21 arch Glenfinnan viaduct  and stops at the village of Glenfinnan where Bonnie Prince Charlie raised his standard in 1745. It also stops at the village of Arisaig on request.
