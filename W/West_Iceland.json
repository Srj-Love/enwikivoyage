Furthest north are Dalirnir (The Valleys), a farming area mainly seen by tourists driving through on their way to North Iceland. Dalirnir contain a remarkable natural phenomenon, though: The hills. There are many of them. Very many in fact. And some of the hills have hills on top of them. Icelandic legend has it that the hills are so many that they're uncountable.\n\nA second uncountable phenomenon is found to the west of Dalirnir. Breiðafjörður is a large bay scattered with a supposedly uncountable number of small islands. In earlier times these islands were all used for farming purposes, but today only one of them is inhabited, the island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flatey"]]},".\n\nSouth of Breiðafjörður is a large, long peninsula. Snæfellsnes is one long mountain range with stunning, if barren, beauty. Dotted along the coastline are fishing communities, with farming taking place on the little lowland regions found between the coast and the mountains. \n\nFinally, to the south of Snæfellsnes, there is the farming area surrounding Borgarfjörður. This is an important agricultural area, reaching far inland. Borg, the farm after which both Borgarfjörður and the town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Borgarnes"]]}," are named, was the home of Egill Skallagrímsson, the titular character of Egil's Saga. Further inland, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reykholt"]]}," was home to Snorri Sturluson, one of the most important players in Iceland's 14th century civil war and chronicler of Norwegian kings. Today the area is home to two universities, the Icelandic University of Agriculture and Bifröst University.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nWest Iceland is linked to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southwest Iceland"],["Southwest"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Iceland"]]}," via the ring road. Note that if arriving from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reykjavík"]]},", you will most likely go through a tunnel under Hvalfjörður (the fjord marking the start of West Iceland). This is the only toll road in Iceland, and for vehicles shorter than 6 meters each trip costs 1000 kr. If you'll be going back and forth a lot, there's a discount card for ten trips at 6350 kr. Whichever direction you're driving, the toll booths are on the north. An alternative to paying is to drive around Hvalfjörður. It's a scenic drive, and well worth it if you have the time. Since the tunnel was built, the traffic levels are very low and sights include the country's only whaling station in operation as well as innumerable waterfalls, mountains and rivers. However it's a long drive, 59km as opposed to the 6km long tunnel.\n\nIf you're arriving from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Westfjords"]]},", there are two roads, one on each coast of the peninsula that links the regions. Alternatively you can take a ferry from Brjánslækur, on the south coast of the Westfjords, called Baldur ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/seatours.is\/FerryBaldur\/"]},". Note that Brjánslækur is only a ferry port and the closest towns are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bíldudalur"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Patreksfjörður"]]},", both around 50km away. The terminal on the West Iceland side of the route is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stykkishólmur"]]}," on Snæfellsnes, with a stop in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flatey"]]}," on the way.\n\nThere are no scheduled flights into West Iceland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nRoads mainly trace the coastline in West Iceland, with a few mountain passes and more inland roads in the rural area northeast of Borgarfjörður. The Ring Road bypasses large sections of the region, including Snæfellsnes and Dalirnir, meaning traffic can be very light. Although most roads are paved, the very tip of the Snæfellsnes peninsula is not, nor are some of the mountain passes. If driving, beware that in some places the road on Snæfellsnes sits on a very narrow ledge, with a long and steep fall to the sea below.\n\nDriving on your own is the most flexible way of getting around, but there are some bus routes operated by Sterna ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sterna.is\/en"]},". Hitch hiking is an option for those travelling by bus who want to reach destinations not served by the bus system.\n\nTo get to the islands of Breiðafjörður, a boat is needed. Only Flatey is served by regular ferries from Stykkishólmur, crossing over to Brjánslækur on the south coast of the Westfjords. If you wish to visit other islands you will need to arrange transportation locally, but frankly most of them are small and without much to see.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nNatural beauty is the main attraction of the region, particularly Snæfellsnes and the islands of Breiðafjörður.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Deildartunguhver"]}," – Europe's biggest hot spring, measured in amounts of water.

However there is some important food production. Snæfellsnes is a fishing area, so look for fresh fish, especially in the small villages on the western end of the peninsula. Búðardalur is known in Iceland for its cheese production, although the cheese produced are generally not local (brie, cheddar etc.). There are geothermal areas in the vicinity of Borgarfjörður, and by extention there is greenhouse farming. Sometimes it will be possible to buy vegetables straight from the farmer and there's a popular stall selling tomatoes by Deildartunguhver.\n\nMost villages will have some restaurants, but there are also some interesting rural eating options with fantastic scenery . These include Hótel Búðir (fine dining) and Fjöruhúsið (a small café), both on the southern coast of Snæfellsnes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nWest Iceland has a local beer, and a local vodka. The beer is called Jökull and brewed by Mjöður Brugghús in Stykkishólmur. Reyka Vodka is distilled in Borgarnes.\n\nAs everywhere in Iceland, alcohol can only be bought in Vínbúðin. This can be interesting in some of the smaller villages and in Ólafsvík the liquor store also happens to be a baby clothes store.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nDon't worry about crime - you probably won't see very many people at all.  The biggest risk is falling off the road.  Especially going up the mountain, be careful and watch for oncoming traffic.\n\nAs the Peninsula sticks directly into the Atlantic, the area tends to be very windy.\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Iceland"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Western Region (Iceland)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["64.88627"],["-21.82434"],["zoom=8"]]}]
