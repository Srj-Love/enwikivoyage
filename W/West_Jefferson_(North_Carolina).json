A station was built southwest of Jefferson, and the new town of West Jefferson sprang up around the depot. West Jefferson became the county's commercial hub, a role it continues to hold even though N&W ended service to Ashe County after tracks were washed out in a flood in the mid-1970s. Today it's difficult to trace the original railroad bed, but West Jefferson remembers the role the train played in its development through murals on buildings and through preservation of the original depot.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFrom Boone, you follow US 221 to the traffic light at the intersection of 221 and NC 163, where you turn left and take Business 221 into West Jefferson.
