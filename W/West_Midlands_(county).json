Birmingham was pivotal in the production of arms in both WWI and WWII.  Much of the area to the North and West of Birmingham city centre is known as the Black Country due to its association with coal and industry. Many of these were known for particular trades and the association continues to this day: for example, in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jewellery Quarter"]]}," of Birmingham, or with the glass industry in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stourbridge"]]},". The area is also notable for its vast network of canals: today over 100 miles of canal is navigable within the West Midlands, and at its peak in the early nineteenth century this was around 160 miles - it is popular in the area to state that the area has more miles of canal than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Venice"]]},".
