Although ",{"type":"'''","value":["fjords"]}," can be found in other parts of the world, the word is Norwegian, and this is the region of Norway where the most of the iconic fjords can be found.  A fjord (the \"j\" is pronounced like an \"y\" in English) is a long, narrow, deep bay, usually surrounded by equally steep mountainous terrain.  In West Norway, the largest can extend 200 km (124 mi) inland, 1300 m (4265 ft) deep. The great fjords of western Norway cuts deep into the mainland and are particularly dramatic at the intersection with the high central mountains from Hardangervidda via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jotunheimen"]]}," to the \"alps\" around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Åndalsnes"]]},". Most fjords continue onshore as deep u-shaped (often gorge-like) valleys such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lærdal"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Romsdal"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sunndal"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gudvangen"]]},", several of these valleys are home to pretty, usually very deep, lakes such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Olden"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eidfjord"]]}," lakes. Note that in some areas major freshwater lakes, although not connected to the ocean, are frequently called fjords. The fjords of western Norway has been rated as the world's top tourist destination by National Geographic Magazine. In a rating of UNESCO world heritage sites, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Geiranger"]]},", in Møre og Romsdal and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gudvangen"],["Nærøyfjord"]]},", in Sogn og Fjordane, also obtained top score in a survey conducted by National Geographic.\n\nSeveral great waterfalls can be found in Western Norway. Many of them fall directly into the famous fjords as well as along the deep valleys extending into the mountains beyond the fjords. Unique in West Norway is that these waterfalls are found in large number all across the region.\n\nThe only really even lowland area is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jæren"]]},", the region south of Stavanger. Jæren also has long stretches of sandy beaches and is not protected by lines of islands and skerries like the rest of this extremely fragmented coast. The beaches at Jæren are popular among kiters and surfers. Other flat lowlands include a small number of islands such as Smøla and Giske. Elsewhere the terrain is in general extremely fragmented along the ocean as well as in the interior where grand fjords, green gentle valleys and steep mountains dominate.\n\nWhile famous for its natural landscapes, West Norway is also very rich in natural resources and a economically strong region. The rich fisheries of the North Sea and Atlantic lies just off the shores of West Norway, so does the oil and gas fields on the Norwegian continental shelf. Redundancy of water and steep mountains make West Norway ideal for hydro electric power production, supplying ample amount of electricity to industry and western cities as well as large parts of East Norway.\n\nThe name \"Norway\" (\"way to the North\") originally referred to the sea lane along the coast of West Norway from somewhere around present day Stavanger and northward. In the Middle Ages West Norwegians were referred to as \"nordmenn\" (\"men of the North\" or \"Norwegians\"), while people of East Norway were called \"austmenn\" (\"Men of the East\"). The name \"Norway\" was subsequently and gradually extended to the entire territory of the present Kingdom of Norway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe language in West Norway is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norwegian phrasebook"],["Norwegian"]]},", with dialects that are distinctly different from eastern dialects.

In tourist hot spots like Geiranger and Bergen, French and German are also common among service personnel. Don't be surprised to meet service workers that manage other languages such as Russian, Dutch, Italian or Spanish.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nBergen and Stavanger have fairly large airports and are well connected with several European cities and major Norwegian cities. \n\nThere are also international flights to Haugesund, Molde and Ålesund.
