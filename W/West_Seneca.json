In 2000, the Town of West Seneca opened the Charles E. Burchfield Nature & Art Center on the former site of Gardenville Park, where Burchfield painted some of his most famous nature scenes. Today, these 29 acres (11ha) of woodland are traversed with footpaths and peppered with gardens and interpretive exhibits regarding local flora and fauna as well as the art of Charles Burchfield. Trees such as maple, birch, aspen, hickory, and oak, plants such as wild rose, raspberry, and dogwood, and a wide array of native animal life are to be found at the Burchfield Center."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Though it is not a shopping mall in the traditional sense of the term, with enclosed corridors, the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.southgateplaza.com Southgate Plaza"]}]}," is a greatly important shopping destination for area residents.
