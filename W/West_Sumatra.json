Water buffaloes are a symbol of West Sumatra and are used in rendang, a rich and spicy buffalo meat or beef dish. Padang food comes from West Sumatra. The Padang food restaurant chains can be found throughout Indonesia and neighboring countries, thus render it as probably the most popular regional dish in Indonesia.

Don't grimace - bitter black tea poured over whipped egg and sugar creates a custardy flavoured \"cappuccino froth\" on your tea. The best has a squeeze of lime. My recommendation for teh talua is Desy's cafe in Jl Pasar Baru I, in Central Padang behind the main market, but more specifically for navigating there, behind the Balai Kota (Town Hall) and Police Station (\"Belakang Benteng\" is a really clear instruction to a driver) The tiny cafe is where police staff eat and Desyeni the proprietor has a solid lineage of culinary expertise behind her.

Tabuik is also the term used to refer to the high funeral biers carried around during remembrance procession. Originally this was a Shi'a festival, but nowadays, most Muslim and even non-Muslim inhabitants participate in Pariaman and other areas where similar Tabuik festivals are held. The tabuik itself is made from bamboo, rattan and paper. During the week of Tabuik many activities are held including kite races and traditional plays such as Tari Piring. The remembrance draws a large crowd including dignitaries such as the provincial governor, to see the tabuik in the morning before it is slowly taken to the beach. After the tabuik are thrown into the sea, many people go swimming looking for souvenirs of the tabuik to keep.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nSafer than most other areas because of a Muslim ethic and intact social fabric. Keep safe by making friends. The Minang take great community responsibility. Talk to people and they will look out for you as one of their own. At the same time crime exists and normal precautions should be taken. Importantly, respect their values and, if female, try not to travel alone after dark--in company with other women is OK. The ethos - the community can't look after you if you don't look after yourself. Or if you go places where the honest eyes can't see. So being alone or the only female in male company at night is considered asking for it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Sumatra"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:West Sumatra"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-1"],["100.5"]]}]
