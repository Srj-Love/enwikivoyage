Rich in natural resources, physical beauty, and traditional culture, West Virginia's charm is that of being \"off the beaten path\". West Virginia is a destination for white water rafting, kayaking, skiing, climbing, golf, mountain biking, hiking, and off-roading. It is the only state that is entirely contained in Appalachia. Its location between the mid-west and eastern seaboard of the United States means that over 60% of the United States population lives less than 500 miles from West Virginia.\n\nWest Virginia is abundant in natural resources, being primarily known as a major producer of coal since the 1800s — in fact, it's the number-two coal producing state in the US. However, it has never been a particularly wealthy state, particularly outside the larger towns; per capita income is quite low, and the poverty levels are some of the highest in the nation. From the point of view of the traveller, this isn't necessarily a negative. The people in rural areas may not have much material wealth, but they're down-to-earth, grateful for what they have, and very friendly and hospitable, and this attitude toward life generally applies to people in the larger cities as well. You'll receive a very warm welcome, as long as you respect their Southern politeness and try to return it in kind (which means: be patient, smile, engage in small talk, and no jokes about hillbillies or inbreeding).\n\nAs a visitor, you'll find that West Virginia has a lot to offer. There's beautiful natural scenery, quaint mountain towns, delicious down-home country food, traditional handicrafts, lots of pioneer and Civil War history, outdoor activities of the rollicking and stately varieties, and great cultural opportunities. The pace of life is slow and relaxed, but with so many exciting things to do, West Virginia is a wonderful destination for a quiet getaway or a weekend adventure.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nGiven its position as a boundary state between the North and the South, your perception of the West Virginia dialect will probably depend on where you're from. People from the North think that West Virginians have a Southern accent, whereas people from the South perceive them as speaking a more Northern dialect. Nevertheless, most West Virginians do have at least a bit of a Southern twang, particularly if you venture into the more remote mountain communities.\n\nThere is no single West Virginia dialect. In areas of the state which border Ohio and Pennsylvania, the pronunciations tend to be more northern, with the primary marker being the long \"I\" sound. Some will voice the diphthong \"aye\" in the northern style, while others make the \"ah\" sound. Those in the interior of the state speak in a manner more like people from Kentucky or southern Virginia. In the southern counties particularly, you will find a very pronounced southern twang.\n\nVariations in dialects can be traced to immigration patterns. The coal fields of the southeastern part of the state were the destination of miners immigrating from Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In the more industrialized areas along the Ohio River, the immigrant population was comprised of large numbers of eastern European immigrants.\n\nIn the most southern part of the state, there are communities which are almost entirely African-American. During the mine wars of the late 1800s, mine owners hired former slaves from the southern states to replace striking miners. Because these communities tend to be segregated (by choice), the dialects of the southern slaves live on in their speech.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ohio_River_Valley.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["Ohio Valley"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThere are three main interstates in West Virginia: ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-64"]}," crosses the lower third of the state from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kentucky"]]}," into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Huntington (West Virginia)"],["Huntington"]]},", through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Charleston (West Virginia)"],["Charleston"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beckley"]]},", and then past ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lewisburg (West Virginia)"],["Lewisburg"]]}," into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Virginia"]]},".
