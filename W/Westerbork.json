Fines will be given to those who ignore this restriction. You'll have to park at the memorial centre, which is located some 2.7km from the actual camp site, and walk the educational path to the camp. Wheelchairs are available for those who need them. You can't rent bicycles, but if you're here with your own, you may use it.
