Until 1975 Lewis formed part of the county of Ross and Cromarty and the rest of the archipelago, including Harris, was part of Inverness-shire.\n\nIn 1975 Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) was established, which increased political interest in island connections. In 1999 a causeway between North Uist and Berneray opened, followed by a causeway between Eriskay and South Uist which opened in 2001. This forms the basis of the route described here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\nNo advance booking is required. Tickets are bought from the bus drivers and the ferry staff.

High winds can also result in ferries being cancelled.\n\nGenerally there are five departures per day, except Sunday, from Castlebay, but only the first two allow the route to be completed in a day.
