It is also the most ethnically diverse, mountainous, and scenic region of Mongolia, with thousands of years of history. The region is home to the Kazakhs, a Muslim tribe from near the Caspian Sea, and Oirats, or western Mongols, which can be divided into 10 different tribes, as well as Khalkhs, or eastern Mongols. In addition to the ethnic diversity, the region is home to the Altai Mountain Range, with the highest peaks in Mongolia, Lake Uvs, a large saltwater lake, and many smaller lakes, mountains, rivers, forests, and steppe. Spread throughout the region are countless archeological sites with petroglyphs, cave paintings, standing stone monuments, monasteries, and ancient forts that date back as far as 10,000 years.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hovd"]]}," in Hovd Aimag has a Manchu Fort and cave drawings outside the city.

This location near the crossroad of civilization has left the landscape littered with history of many groups either originating in these mountain valleys or passing through on their way to conquest. Over the last 10,000 years, the Blue Turks, Scythians, Tuvans, Hun, Mongols, Uighurs, and Kazakhs all spread out from or through the region to take over more settled peoples. It wasn't until the 1930s that all of the Altai mountains was firmly controlled with fixed borders by outside powers, and even then only after many years of bloody resistance. This legacy of independence can still be seen in the customs of the diverse population which can be broadly divided into Kazakhs, Tuvans, Khalkh Mongols, and Oirat Mongols (which can be divided into roughly 10 distinct tribes). These groups have adapted their cultures to handle the difficulties of living in this cold, dry, mountainous place. This region with the Altai Mountains in the west, Gobi Desert in the east and south, the Great Mongolian Lakes depression in the north and center, and forests, steppe, and deserts mixed throughout support some rare and spectacular wildlife. Large and endangered animals call the region home including snow leopards, the Govi Bear, Argali sheep, ibex, antelope, gazelle, falcons, golden eagles, wolves, foxes, and many more. Many more birds use the many lakes as rest stops on their annual migration between Siberia and Southeast Asia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Mongolian phrasebook"],["Mongolian"]]}]}," is the official language and is spoken by almost everyone in the region, although ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kazakh phrasebook"],["Kazakh"]]}]}," is the native language of most of Bayan-Ölgii and some in Hovd. In the countryside of Bayan-Ölgii, particularly near Altai Tavan Bogd National Park, Kazakh is the primary language and some people will have only limited knowledge of Mongolian (This can be a problem with Mongolian tour guides). Russian can be used occasionally among middle-aged and older people, while English is only spoken by very few people.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFlights for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulaanbaatar"]]}," to airports in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ölgii"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hovd"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulaangom"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uliastai"]]}," (at Donoi Airport) daily or several times a week on Eznis, AeroMongolia, or Hunnu Air. There is also a flight to Tsontsengel in Zavkhan on Sky Horse Aviation. Direct buses from the Dragon Center in Ulaanbaatar to each Aimag Center also available several times a week. These buses take 48 hours to Ölgii and 40 to Hovd or Ulaangom under ideal conditions (can be much longer). It is sometimes possible to get a shared jeep ride between Aimag Centers like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Altai_(Mongolia)"],["Altai (Govi-Altai)"]]}," to Hovd or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tsetserleg"]]}," to Ulaangom or Uliastai via Tosontsengel village in the northeast corner of Zavkhan.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIt is often easier to get into the region than to get around it. While every provincial capital has direct flights and nonstop bus route connecting to the capital, transportation between provinces usually means spending several hours stuffed like a sardine inside an overcrowded Russian jeep or van. There is regular 'shared jeep' transit to the villages from the capitals, and between some, but not all neighboring provinces. Shared jeeps meet in the 'black market' in most cities and mostly leave in the afternoon. Drivers going between cities and surrounding villages on regular routes mostly live in the village and leave the village in the morning and return in the afternoon. If you are planning on hitchhiking or taking public transit across the region, plan on going through Hovd instead of Ulaangom to get to Bayan-Ölgii, as Hovd serves as the business and political center of the west.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe diversity of people, history, landscapes, and animals makes this remote region worth the effort to visit. The archeological history of the region dates back several thousand years, with petroglyphs, Turkic standing stone statues, various tombs, monuments, and artifacts spread throughout the deserts, mountain passes, steppe, and forests of the area. The descendents of these ancient artisans today still herd animals in a semi-nomadic lifestyle that is similar to the times of Genghis Khan with small variations depending on which of the roughly 12 tribes and nationalities live here. Though often much harder to find than the cave drawings or nomadic ger-dwellers, many rare and endangered animals inhabit the region including the snow leopard, Argali sheep, ibex, Przewalski horse, and more common animals like the grey wolf, Corsac fox, golden eagle, lynx, brown bear, and many smaller animals. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Altai Mountains"]}," forms border between China and the provinces of Bayan-Ölgii and Hovd, as well as covers most of both provinces, while the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tannu Ola Range"]}," forms the border between Russia and Uvs province, and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Khangai Mountains"]}," cover most of eastern Zavkhan.
