The discovery of silver in 1859 led to a massive mining boom in the area creating fortunes for some and poverty and despair for most.  The nickname for Nevada, The Silver State, was coined for this era.    The most enduring legacy of the Comstock rush is the advances to mining technology the effort to extract silver brought.\n\nThe mining history of this region is very much in alive with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Virginia City (Nevada)"],["Virginia City"]]}," being the crown jewel of the mining district.  The parallel history of the railroads that supported the mines is also very much in the forefront here in the form of the Nevada State Railroad Museum in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carson City"]]}," and a restored section of the historic Virginia and Truckee Railroad running passenger excursions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe climate in this region ranges from the forested mountains around Lake Tahoe to the semi-arid high desert of the eastern areas in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges.  With this wide variation in altitude and climate, temperatures and precipitation vary throughout the region.\n\nFor the areas east of the mountains, the annual low is about 19°F and the high is 92°F (-7°C–33°C) with annual precipitation of about 7.5 in (19 cm).  For Lake Tahoe area, the large body of water had a moderating effect on the temperature with a low of 23°F and a high of 78°F (-5°C–25°C). Annual precipitation is about 18 in (45 cm).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nThe southwestern portion of this region is dominated by Lake Tahoe and heavily forested slopes surrounding it.

This region is known for its skiing in the winter and provides a cool escape from the heat of the lower eastern portions of the region during the summer.\n\nThe remainder of this region slopes down to the east into the Great Basin ranging from 5,000 ft to 3,500 ft (1,524–1,066 m) in elevation.  As with much of Nevada, the terrain is composed of north-south trending mountain ranges with valleys in between.
