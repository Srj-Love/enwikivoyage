When you drive into Lviv, make sure you have a good map because getting lost in this town is very easy.\n\nPay close attention to speed limits (which are often badly marked, with signs far off the road, covered with branches etc.), but the speeding fines are usually low if nothing else is wrong with your car. In towns, the speed limit is usually 60 km\/h (40 mph). Speed limits on \"nationals\" (single carriageway countryside roads) is 90 km\/h (55 mph). The poor average quality of the roads already acts as a speed checker. Speed limits on highways (motorways) is 110–120 km\/h (75 mph).\n\nBe aware that corruption is widespread among Ukrainian police. When you are stopped for speeding or other violations, officers might aggressively try and extract ridiculous sums of money from you (€100 and up), offering \"reductions\" if you pay on the spot (the proposed alternative being some unpleasant and more expensive way, all made up). \n\nThe highest actual legal fine in the Ukraine is the equivalent of about $200. But the fine should be paid in the bank, not directly to police officer! So if you're asked for fine demand a written ticket for you to pay later instead. Don't let them intimidate you. It's very useful to have an embassy phone number handy for these cases (you should NOT under any circumstances travel around Ukraine without your embassy\/consulate number handy anyway). If you mention your embassy\/consulate, they'll let you off the hook quicker than you know it. At any rate, write down the officers' badge numbers, rank, plate number of the police car, and notify the nearest embassy\/consulate in detail, to help fight these corrupt practices.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\nTake a train to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Przemyśl"]]}," near the Polish-Ukrainian border. From Kraków it costs about ~50 PLN and takes between 4 and 5 hours. From Przemyśl you take a bus to Medyka at the border ('granica' in Polish) for PLN2.

If you do encounter a queue and are in a hurry, get the guards attention, explain your situation and they will more than likely let you go through immediately. Be polite! 30 minutes from Medyka to Sheheni (Шегині) on foot is now the norm.\n\n::There are lots of \"ants\" - these are people who cross into Poland with relatively cheap Ukrainian cigarettes and spirits, then buy meats and cheeses at low EU prices and return to Ukraine to sell them for a profit. Everyone has to pass through a turnstile and the bulky bags and suitcases they carry are too big to fit. There is a huge log jam of people trying to fit their bags through that turnstile and ugly words are common. Tourists with backpacks are sometimes let through by the \"ants\".\n\nOn the Ukraine side private buses can be taken to Lviv; these take about 1.5 hours, and can be found at the bus station around 300m up the main road, past all the shops, on the first major road to your left. Right outside the border you will probably meet touts who will tell you that they have best prices and invite to their cars and buses, this option may be faster but is definitely more expensive. The price for a bus from the station is UAH24.5 (Apr 2013); the buses are often packed and can be uncomfortable at times. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Be aware that there are NO ATMs in Sheheni, period."]}," However, there are lots of money changers, so make sure you bring enough currency of some sort to pay for your ticket to L'viv.The bus from Shehyni will most likely arrive next to the main train station in Lviv.\n\nThe total cost for this route is approximately €15 and maybe less if you have a student card.

Similarly if you decide to use the toilet you may find it blocked with cartons of cigarettes and your seat may feel uncomfortable if someone's removed the soft filling and replaced it with cigarettes. The key here is to exercise your common sense. These people are only doing their 'job' and thus should be treated with respect. There is no need for alarm!
