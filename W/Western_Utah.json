Built entirely of mud, salt crystals, basalt rocks, earth, and water on the northeastern shore of the Great Salt Lake near Rozel Point, it forms a 1,500-foot-long (460 m), 15-foot-wide (4.6 m) counterclockwise coil jutting from the shore of the lake which is only visible when the level of the Great Salt Lake falls below an elevation of 4,197.8 feet (1,279.5 m). Construction of the Jetty occured during a drought when the water level of the lake was unusually low; however, within a few years, the water level returned to normal and submerged the Jetty for the next three decades. It first resurfaced in 2004, and changing water levels have submerged and uncovered the Jetty several times in the years since. Originally black basalt rock against ruddy water, it is now largely white against pink due to salt encrustation and lower water levels.\n\nThe Jetty is ",{"type":"''","value":["extremely"]}," far from most human habitation.  It is located 17 miles by dirt road, through active pasturelands, from the Golden Spike National Historic Site, which is itself ~32 (paved) miles from the nearest town of Corrine, Utah.  Ensure you will have gas enough for the ~100 mile roundtrip, and time enough to be back on paved roads before dark.\n\nIn poor weather conditions it can be extremely dangerous to attempt to visit the Spiral Jetty as even though there are signs directing you to the Jetty, it would be very easy to get lost if they are missed due to poor visibility.  An accident with the cattle that are often found on the road would leave you not only stranded, but liable for the damages to the livestock.\n\nThe Spiral itself will most likely be partially or fully submerged when you arrive, although a climb up the nearby hills can provide a better vantage point from which the Jetty can be seen even if it is underwater.\n\nOther art installations in the desert of Western Utah include the ",{"type":"{{","value":[["marker"],["type=see"],["name=Tree of Utah"],["lat=40.73421"],["long=-113.55130"]]},", an abstract structure vaguely resembling a tree that makes for a memorable roadside landmark about half way across the salt flats on Interstate 80, and the ",{"type":"{{","value":[["marker"],["type=see"],["name=Sun Tunnels"],["lat=41.30385"],["long=-113.86379"],["image=Sun Tunnel.jpg"]]},", a series of concrete tunnels with sun holes on the top in the shape of constellations.
