There is now strong evidence that whale watching can significantly affect the biology and ecology of whales and dolphins.\n\nEnvironmental campaigners, concerned by what they consider the \"quick-buck\" mentality of some boat owners, continue to strongly urge all whale watcher operators to contribute to local regulations governing whale watching (no international standard set of regulations exist because of the huge variety of species and populations).
