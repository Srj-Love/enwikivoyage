In the years between 1850 and 1909 these shipyards produced over 100 ships - schooners, brigantines and ketches - which sailed the high seas and ended up in all corners of the globe.\n\nThose days are past, but the unspoilt beauty remains to delight the traveller. The harbour itself is the jewel in a crown of beautiful bays that encircle Whangaroa's coastline. There are still substantial areas of native bush within the county. The small townships and settlements keep their sense of history and some of their original buildings remain to carry whispers of the past into the 21st century. Whangaroa remains a mecca for the game fisherman. Pristine white sand beaches and clear water create a mecca  in summer time for holiday makers.
