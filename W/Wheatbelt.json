With the advance across the landscape, railway lines, and small communities on the side of the railway developed.  With the rise of the technology, bulk wheat silos were built, and the railway system stayed more or less intact until the 1960s (in 1965 305 wheat silos or depots were in action).  \nWith the demise of steam locomotive power in 1971, and the railways new focus on bulk transport in the 1980s, a lot of the wheatbelt has changed.  \n\nBy the 2010s the wheatbelt has a vast range of small one shop towns, and in some places there are museums to explain what had happened in the region. The remnants of the former prosperous region are a fascinating collection of towns along the old railway routes.  There are many ways to venture into the wheatbelt and get glimpses of what is happening now.\n\nThere are scattered throughout the wheatbelt small nature reserves where remnant vegeation has been spared.  And a large range of small lakes, and also granite rock outcrops.\n\nWildflowers are in full bloom during August to September\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\nWith a good network of sealed roads and gravel tracks, many drive routes are suitable for a conventional vehicle.
