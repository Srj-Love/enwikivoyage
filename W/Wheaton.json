It was named after Union General Frank Wheaton, who defended nearby Fort Stevens and D.C. in the Civil War in July 1964.

The north\/south being Brookeville Pike, now Rt. 97 Georgia Ave, ran from Washington D.C. to Baltimore.   Veirs Mill Rd. was used a coach road with sections of plank road, which ran from Wheaton to Rockville.  Lastly, the third road was Old Bladensburg Rd., now University Blvd, that connected Bethesda, Chevy Chase, and Bladensburg. \n\nBefore 1947 only 29,000 people were living in Wheaton on farms and large estates, however in 1950 and 1960 the number of residents increased tremendously, which led to the widening of Georgia Ave, also known as the “Avenue of Progess”.  Since then there has been a tremendous amount of businesses that have blossomed such as the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in 1959, and Wheaton Regional Park in 1958. \n\nHowever because Wheaton is so close to the large Silver Spring area many residents were unhappy because of their loss of identity, therefore in 1965 the community residents of Wheaton and Kensington gained permission to use Wheaton, MD for specific zip codes such as 20902 and many others. \nThe area has developed extremely since its humble beginnings and is now known as a central business area with a diverse community surrounded by major roads and transit systems. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nComing out of the Wheaton Metro station on the Red Line, admire that escalator—it's the longest in the Western Hemisphere, taking over four minutes to ascend!\n\nThe main streets running through the downtown are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Georgia Ave"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Veirs Mill Rd"]},", and ",{"type":"'''","value":["University Blvd"]},"—the area where they converge (and the disorganized strip malls just east before the Metro stop) is the center of commercial activity, and is cram packed with great cheap restaurants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Wheaton map.png"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Downtown Wheaton"]]},"\n\nDowntown Wheaton, as shown in the map to the right, is very compact and dense with shops and restaurants, and is easily walkable from the Metro.
