The first known European sighting of Whidbey Island was during the 1790 Spanish expedition of Manuel Quimper and Gonzalo López de Haro on the Princesa Real. The island was fully explored in 1792 by Captain George Vancouver. In May of that year, Royal Navy officers and members of Vancouver's expedition, Joseph Whidbey and Peter Puget, began to map and explore the areas of what would later be named Puget Sound. After Whidbey circumnavigated the island in June 1792, Vancouver named the island in his honor.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Goose Rock Trail (Whidbey Island, Washington State).jpg"],["300px"],["thumbnail"],["Goose Rock Trail on Whidbey Island"]]},"\nThe first known overnight stay on Whidbey Island by a non-native American was made on May 26, 1840 by a Catholic missionary during travel across Puget Sound.\n\nLieutenant Charles Wilkes, commander of the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838–1842, sailed the USS Vincennes into Penn Cove in 1841. There he found the largest Native settlement on Puget Sound[citation needed] and noted that a Catholic mission had been started with a 2-acre (8,100 m2) fenced garden. Wilkes named the lower cove Holmes Harbor, after his assistant surgeon, Silas Holmes.\n\nIn 1850, Colonel Isaac N. Ebey became the first permanent white settler on Whidbey Island, claiming a square mile (2.6 km²) of prairie with a southern shoreline on Admiralty Inlet. Even though he was farming potatoes and wheat on his land, he was also the postmaster for Port Townsend, Washington and rowed a boat daily across the inlet in order to work at the post office there. On August 11, 1857, Colonel Ebey was murdered and beheaded by Haida who traveled from the Queen Charlotte Islands when he was 39 years old. Ebey was slain in proxy-retaliation for the killing of a Haida chief at Port Gamble. Fort Ebey, named for the Colonel, was established in 1942 on the west side of the central part of the island, just northwest of Coupeville.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\nWhidbey Island is mostly residential and farmlands with a few small towns nicely spaced apart for the visiting traveler.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Coupeville.JPG"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["Old Grain Wharf, in the harbour of Coupeville, in the Central Whidbey Island Historic District, part of the Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve."]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Clinton (Washington)"],["Clinton"]]}," a small town on the southern tip of Whidbey Island.."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coupeville"]]}," - county seat of Island County and home to a Washington State Ferry terminal.

It had a fourth order Fresnel lens, and the light could be seen sixteen miles away. This light welcomed Puget Sound marine traffic to Admiralty Inlet. In 1890, with construction of the fort to protect Admiralty Inlet, the light was relocated, relinquishing the building and site to the U.S. Army. The original Red Bluff wooden lighthouse was demolished to make room for soldiers and guns in Fort Casey. The replacement lighthouse, constructed of brick and stucco, was built in 1903 but was discontinued in 1922. It was the last brick lighthouse designed by renowned German architect Carl Leick. During its later occupancy by the Army, the lighthouse was used as a training facility for the K-9 dog program.  The lighthouse was deactivated in 1922, and the lantern moved to the New Dungeness Lighthouse in 1927. The 30 foot (9 m) tall lighthouse has since been restored by the Washington State Parks and is sponsored by the \"Lighthouse Environmental Program\"(LEP), a collaborative function between Washington State University's Extension Office and local environmental programs.
