With 37 lifts servicing over 200 runs on two mountains and a vertical drop of over 1,500 meters (5,000 feet), Whistler-Blackcomb is the largest ski resort in North America and consistently ranks as one of the top three ski destinations in North America. The variety of terrain is huge — ranging from beginner areas to chutes and trees and groomed cruising runs to alpine bowls heaped with powder after a fresh snow fall — so there should be something to suit everyone. On the freestyle side of things, it has four terrain parks, a snow cross track and a superpipe.\n\nIf you are staying in Whistler Village or are parked in the day lots, the closest access point for both mountains is the two gondolas from Skiers Plaza in Whistler Village.  The ride up takes 20-25 minutes and lineups can be long during the morning. Whistler Creekside has a gondola that accesses the southwest side of Whistler Mountain. This is a long walk from the Village so it is only useful if you are staying in the Creekside area or have a car. Village North has a couple of lifts that access Blackcomb Mountain and a beginners area. The gondolas start operation at 8:30AM and stop between 3PM and 4PM, depending on the time of the year. Snow conditions are available from the Snow Phone at +1-800-766-0449.\n\nBoth mountains open the fourth weekend of November and the main season runs until late April. Conditions permitting, the resort will keep one of the mountains open until early June for spring skiing.
