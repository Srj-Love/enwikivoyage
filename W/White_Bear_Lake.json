The majority of service is commuter based, and hence is mostly outbound during AM rush hour, and inbound during PM rush hour. It is advisable to avoid bus travel in the Twin Cities for all but the most researched mass transit users. A bus journey from White Bear Lake to Minneapolis St. Paul international airport, for example, is a very long and complicated journey involving numerous bus transfers. Bear in mind that just like the rest of the Twin Cites, White Bear Lake is littered with numerous \"Bus Stops,\" yet again these stops are only used by well researched bus riders and one should never assume that an actual bus is going to drive by apart from the AM\/PM rush hours.

Therefore, from US694 use the Highway 61 exit and travel North until you hit 4th Street. Alternatively, from US35E use the Highway 96 exit and travel East, then head North on Highway 61 until 4th Street.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Boat"]},"\n\nThe old paddle-wheel ferry that traveled between Wilernie and Manitou Island, White Bear Lake was shut down in the 1920's and scuttled to the bottom of the lake.

In the unlikely event you've traveled this far away from MSP International without renting a car, all three of the major national car rental firms have locations in nearby Vadnais Heights.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Taxi"]},"\n\nAs of 2012, it has become increasingly reliable and fast to order a taxi in White Bear Lake at most hours.\n\nSuburban Taxi 651-222-2222 regularly maintains drivers in proximity to the area.\n\nPauly the Cabbie 651-248-7545 is based in White Bear Lake.\n\nHowever, in the old days, it was normal for Suburban to claim they would \"Have someone there in 15 minutes!\" no matter how many times one called them back over the course of HOURS to check on the status of the cab they ordered.\n\nSimilarly, Pauly the Cabbie stops taking fares at around 1AM...ideally. However, many times he is too busy to take your fare if even if you call well before then, and he does not make scheduled pickups.\n\nThere are many other Twin Cities taxi companies that reportedly serve White Bear Lake, yet there are few reports of their reliability.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nDuring the summer, a fun place to treat yourself to an ice cream is the Cup and Cone (www.cupandconewbl.com)located at 2126 Fourth St, just off of Highway 61.
