The Weeks Act permitted the repurchase of the lands starting in 1914 with the original purchase of  7,000 acres (28.32 km²). Today the White Mountain National Forest has grown to 800,000 acres (3,237 km²).\n\nDue to the early settlement of the area the Forest contains many historical sites. Early day farms, logging camps, mills, factories, CCC camps, old railroads, cemeteries. The Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Micman, and Maliseet, and other tribes in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont see the White Mountains as a spiritual place. The highest peak in the northeast, Mt.
