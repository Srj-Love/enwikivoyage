Northward, the plateau gradually narrows and rises in elevation to a 'prow' above 13,000' (4,000m) at Montgomery and Boundary Peaks, then the range drops and ends at Montgomery Pass.  However the high point of the range --- ",{"type":"'''","value":["White Mountain Peak"]}," (14,252'\/4,344m)  --- is essentially an extinct volcano piled on top of the triangular plateau some 15 miles (25 km.) south of the prow.\n\nThis is the highest mountain range totally within the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Basin"]]}," of the western United States.  The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sierra Nevada"]]}," range along this basin's western border has two slightly higher summits, making White Mountain Peak California's third highest, or the twentieth highest peak of the U.S. outside Alaska.\n\nThe White Mountains are separated from the Sierra Nevada by downfaulted ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Owens Valley"]]},".  On the east side the California-Nevada state line nearly parallels the range and crosses the crest near its north end so that Boundary Peak (13,147'\/4,007m) is Nevada's highest summit while all other high summits are in California.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nWhile the Sierra Nevada to the west have conventional mountain scenery of the type familiar in advertisements and calendars, the White Mountains offer a less cliched experience.  Viewed from the Owens Valley the lower southern part of the White Mountains has a gentle aspect contrasting with the precipitous spectacle of the facing Sierra Nevada.  Evidently these are desert mountains with a sprinkling of pine trees but no dense forests.  Then heading north through an upper valley (Chalfant) the range's crest rises from 10,000' to 14,000', becoming an intimidating wall reaching far into the alpine zone. At the northern end, Boundary and Montgomery Peaks are perfectly satisfactory mountains: cliffy, sharp-peaked and often snowcapped.\n\nAround to the east in Nevada's Fishlake Valley departed glaciers have left a dozen cirques separated by massive ridges.  Except for steep cirque headwalls, slopes on this side are gentler and the range has a wide alluvial skirt traversed by green ribbons that turn out to be thickets of birch along permanent streams.  Dirt roads follow many of these across the alluvial fans up into canyons above, invited exploration.  In fact most of the cirques can be hiked to the crest, given enough fortitude to push through brush or clever routefinding to circumvent it.  South near the town Dyer, the eastern slopes of White Mountain Peak assume the contorted look of desert mountains, until the upper cirques and summit finally break clear.\n\nDriving into the range via Westgard Pass, the state highway climbs steeply through sage and boulder fields to a plateau with fairly dense stands of Pinyon Pine and Juniper.  This is the pass and the state highway continues down the other side, but a mountain access road heads north, climbing past Grandview Campground which offers expansive views across the Owens Valley to the Sierras, but no water.  The road leaves the Pinyon\/Juniper zone for brush - sage and Mountain Mahogany.  Then it levels out at about 10,000' along a curious floristic boundary.  The brush zone is confined to shaley brown rock.  Off to the right the substrate turns white - dolomite, a carbonate rock like limestone, only with manganese as well as calcium, and it is thinly forested with trees growing to perhaps 30'\/10m.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nSemi-desert with sagebrush up to a lower timberline at 6,500' (2,000m), then ",{"type":"'''","value":["Single-leaf Pinyon Pine"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Utah Juniper"]}," to about 9,000' (2,700m), ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mountain Mahogany"]}," brush for the next 600' (200m), then ",{"type":"'''","value":["Limber Pine"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bristlecone Pine"]}," to an alpine timberline at 11,000' (3,300m).

However, in desert areas they are common and should be treated cautiously - in general they won't strike unless startled.  Wild horses and domestic cattle should not be approached or harassed.  Bears and mountain lions are extremely rare but possible to upper limits of subalpine zone.\n\nGentle slopes give way to narrow ridges advising ropes and protection along the crest immediately north of White Mountain Peak and on Montgomery Peak at north end of the range.  Hikers in the alpine zone should always be prepared for cold and snow, except in the summer.\n\nMost canyons have permanent streams, but water can be scarce along the crest by late July, except in a saddle midway between White Mountain Peak and Pelissier Flat that is drained by Cabin and Birch Creeks. There may also be semi-permanent snowfields above 12,500' (3,700m), but this should be confirmed visually from Fish Lake Valley east of the range before relying on them for water.\n\nCA State highway 168 should be driven conservatively.  It is narrow with steep grades and sharp curves.\n\nOff-highway drivers should carry enough water, food, tools, parts, towlines, gasoline, and warm clothing to weather minor mishaps. It is prudent to travel in groups of at least two vehicles.  Gravel roads must be driven slowly and carefully to avoid damage from flying stones, skidding off the road, and sudden appearance of washouts or large rocks.  Although 2wd vehicles can go fairly far on poor roads, those with low clearance are probably too vulnerable underneath.  Lastly, be conservative about descending steep downhills on the way in.  You might discover you can't get back up them on the way out.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nHow much more out do you want to get?  OK, you could explore the SilverPeak Range on the east side of Fishlake Valley; views of the White Mountains should be memorable.  At the south end of Fishlake Valley just inside California near the intersection of California  routes 168 and 266 a dirt road heads southeast and descends into Eureka Valley, famous for large sand dunes. From there you can drive over the next ridge to the northern part of Death Valley.  Or you could continue east on Nevada route 266 to U.S. Route 95, then head south to the bright lights of Las Vegas.  Do this after sunset and you will begin to see the neon at such a long distance that it blurs into a fantastic mirage, or even a visitation by space aliens.  If you are a confirmed desert rat, you may find the White Mountains a little too conventional, so the drier Inyo Mountains to the south may be more your cup of tea.  \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["extraregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Sierra Nevada"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:White Mountains (California)"]]}]
