There is a large number of local Italian restaurants of varying quality along with the standard Greek diners and ubiquitous middling Chinese fare. For high end Italian try Merlinos. The Indian restaurant on East Post Rd. just received an excellent in the NY Times review.  For affordable fare stick with one of the several diners. Many of the restaurants have had formal write ups in the times which can be googled. The Old White Plains Mall has an asian supermarket with prepared Chinese and Japanese food at a reasonable price and of course Whole Foods has quality prepared foods as well.\n\nIn addition, there are a variety or restaurants spanning down Mamaroneck Ave with any food anyone could desire.
