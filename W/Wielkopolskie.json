A century later Greater Poland became a duchy within the Seniorat of Poland. It was the local duke Przemysł II who first reunited Poland and became the first new king of Poland in 1295. In the beginning of the 14th century Greater Poland became a province (or voivodeship) of the Kingdom of Poland. During the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 much of its territory was annexed by Prussia, but regained independence as part of the Duchy of Warsaw between 1807-1815. After the Congress of Vienna it was again annexed by Prussia. Following World War I it became part of the Second Polish Republic, but was annexed by Nazi-Germany as the Warthegau after the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. It is again part of Poland since 1945. The Polish October, a anti Soviet uprising, took place in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Poznań"]]}," in 1956, giving the beginning of the Hungarian Uprising that followed this event.
