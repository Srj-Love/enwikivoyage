The main attraction is King Street in the town centre - a venue so rambunctious, it is gated at one end to prevent traffic from hitting drunken revellers spilling out of the myriad pubs and clubs on a mere few hundred yard stretch. The town centre contains one of the largest concentrations of clubs and bars in the UK.

Not long ago the club was infamous in Wigan for drugs and violence with the crowds it drew from all around Wigan, Bolton, Manchester and other surrounding areas.\n\nAs well as King Street, there are many converted old banks on Wallgate but arguably the most interesting establishment has to be the John Bull Chop House. Set in the Wiend (a back street behind JD Wetherspoon on Library Street), the pub is 4 old cottages knocked through and was a seafood shop, dating back to the 1700s and as such is an architectural curiosity, full of sloping floors and ceilings and old style brick work. As well as it's looks, the pub is generally popular with the biking\/rockers fraternity and serves many guest beers. Don't be put off, they are an extremely welcoming crowd and will give you the best night out in Wigan with no hint of trouble. It has a renowned jukebox and hopefully you'll like rock tunes, as that's all you will get out of the oversubscribed jukebox all night. The pub had one of the most well known landlords in Wigan Harold Burgess, Harold struggled with ill health for many years and his wife Margaret ran the pub for many years until his death. His funeral had a 100 motorbike escort. Following Harolds sad loss Margaret retired but their daughter Victoria has taken up the mantle to keep the John Bull as it has been for close on 30 years. Harolds License plate from over the door is framed inside just as you approach the bar in tribute to the great man.\n\nThe Anvil on Hallgate near the bus station is a traditional friendly boozer, with fantastic beer at very reasonable prices. The pub covers most sporting events and is a magnet for Wigan rugby fans.  The Tudor house on New Market Street, a slightly dingy but very atmospheric late bar, appeals mostly to students and the 'alternative' crowd. Real ales are available here. The Swan and Railway, directly opposite North Western station, is a very traditional pub with an attractive mosaic interior, offering a good selection of beers. Just to the north of the town centre, Standishgate and Wigan Lane are the focal point of the 'Lane' pub scene. There are many pubs along here but the most popular are The Royal Oak and the Bowling Green. Both have a wide selection of British and Continental beers and regularly feature music an buffets.
