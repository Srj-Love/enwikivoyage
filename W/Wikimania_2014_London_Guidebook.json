Hundreds of Wikimedians from across the world travel to attend each event.  The first Wikimania was held in 2005 in Frankfurt, Germany.  Since then, Wikimanias have been held every year, always on a different continent.  London 2014 will be the 10th annual Wikimania and the third in Europe.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The Barbican"]},"\nThe conference is taking place at the Barbican Centre.

It partially stands on land that was once a Roman fort, which was later incorporated in the wall that surrounded London until the Georgian era.  Some of the remains of the wall can still be seen in the Barbican estate.\n\nThe area has been destroyed and rebuilt several times.  As part of London, it was hit by the Black Death; in 1348-50 the bodies of plague victims were dumped in a local plague pit, which has recently been found under nearby Charterhouse Square.  In the first week of September 1666 this area, and almost everything around it, burned down during the Great Fire of London.  On 25 August 1940, at 00:15, the first bomb to land on London during World War II hit on Fore St, on the southern edge of the Barbican.  During the subsequent Blitz, the area that would become the Barbican was bombed flat by German air raids.  In 1965, work began on rebuilding the area, with a firm conviction to provide residential buildings to repopulate the City.  It was officially opened in 1969 although the Barbican Centre was not itself opened until 1982.\n\nThe whole estate is now Grade II listed and a site of special architectural interest as an important example of British brutalist architecture. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The City"]},"\nThe Barbican is within the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London\/City of London"],["City of London"]]},", usually just called \"the City\" and sometimes \"the Square Mile\", the original ancient and mediaeval boundaries of the city which retains its traditional form of government quite distinct from that of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"],["Greater London"]]},".\n\nThe City is the banking and trading hub that makes London the financial capital of the world.
