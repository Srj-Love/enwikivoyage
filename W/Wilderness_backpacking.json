Distances on a map never look that hard to cover, but once you find yourself staring up at a 400-foot ridge standing between you and tonight's camp, it's a different story.  Topographic maps will give you a better idea of what you're getting yourself into, as well as being essential for navigation if you're going off-trail.  Unless you have an uncanny sense of direction, you'll probably need a compass, or at least know how to discern north from the time.

Traditional hiking boots could kill a small animal just by being dropped on them (empty) from a few feet up, but modern boots can be much lighter, reducing the drag on every step you take.  You don't necessarily need to spend hundreds of dollars on state of the art boots, but odds are that your favorite athletic shoes or street shoes will leave you very uncomfortable and hold up just as poorly.  Stiff soles and plenty of ankle support are a good idea if you're going over any rocks.\n\nBut buying a new pair of boots just before your trip is an equally bad idea.  Break the boots in, first with short walks, then longer ones.  Wear them around for a week, and you'll know where they rub, if you want to put soft insoles in them, etc. They should conform to the shape of your foot, so by the time you're ready to hike, your boots are too.  The break-in period also helps your feet get used to the boots, building up thin callouses in the spots where they rub a little.\n\nIf the terrain is especially challenging, or if your knees aren't what they used to be, you might benefit from using a hiking stick or a pair of trekking poles (like cross-country ski poles, but without the skis).  They aren't just for the feeble; they can improve your balance and increase your pace by adding some power from your arms to your propulsion.  A hiking stick is also often needed when fording. A sturdy chest-high branch (",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," pulled from a standing tree) will do, or you can buy a telescoping staff or set of poles.  Some of them can double as a camera monopod.  And while this usage isn't recommended, you'd probably rather face an angry cougar ",{"type":"''","value":["with"]}," a pole in your hand than without one.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Wear"]},"\n\nThe type and quantity of clothing to wear depends heavily on the location and season.  The key strategy in all but the hottest climates is to layer your clothing.  If the temperature is going to vary between night and day (and it probably will), carrying a set of clothing for the warm times and another set for the cool times will take up extra space and add extra weight.  Instead bring clothes cool enough for daytime hiking, and bring extra layers to put on over them when it cools off after dark.  \"Convertible\" slacks are handy in warmer weather, allowing you to zip off the legs and turn them into shorts when the day gets warm, or back into long pants for wading through prickly plants.\n\nPacking at least one complete change of clothes ensures that if any item you're wearing gets soaked (by rain, a misstep crossing a stream, sweat, whatever) you'll have another to wear instead.  This is especially important for socks, which are both the most likely item of clothing to get wet and the most important to keep dry.  Spare boots aren't practical, but a pair of cheap flip-flops or loose-fitting light-weight shoes will give your feet a chance to breathe when you're not on the trail, and give you ",{"type":"''","value":["something"]}," to wear after you accidentally dunk your foot in a pond while collecting water. This strategy also works for some other heavy items of clothing. You may not need a complete change for everyone in the company, coordinate items important enough but unlikely to need a change.\n\nAlthough cotton is normally comfy, park rangers call it \"death cloth\".  It soaks up water many times its weight and hence its drying time is very slow, making it a less-than-ideal choice for undershirts and underwear you'll be wearing next to your sweaty skin; synthetic fabrics such as capilene will \"wick\" moisture away from your skin, and can better keep you both cool ",{"type":"''","value":["and"]}," dry.  Many discount stores will also sell suitable shirts in their sports department if you don't want to drop the money on the specialty brands.  Cotton also doesn't keep you warm when it gets wet; wool is a better material for your socks and outerwear.  Cotton t-shirts as a middle layer or for sleeping in are fine.\n\nIf you're expecting rain, your best solution will naturally be waterproof overcoat and boots. However, you can cope with rain even if you don't have those. You should dress in 2–3 layers (even more if it's really cold) which would prevent most of the rain from getting in. Since it's likely that some water will penetrate through the outer layers, you should take them off (despite the cold) whenever there's a break in the rain or if you find good cover, to allow the water to dissipate from the inner layers. On these occasions it's best to also hang the outer layers to dry; if you're on the walk, spread them across the back of your backpack. Also, if you don't have waterproof shoes and trousers, you may find it best to wear three-quarter pants that don't get all the way to your ankles. If the pants are too long, they'd get soaked with water and mud that will hinder your walk and will even wet your socks inside your shoes. Additionally, you should take advantage of every opportunity to dry your cloths, such as at campfires. Just be careful not to put your shoes too close to any source of heat, as the rubber sole might start melting after several minutes, even if it doesn't seem to be all that close to the fire.\n\nDo with this information what you wish: Humans in many cultures across countless centuries have lived without freshly laundered underwear every morning.  Also, keep in mind that the kind of underwear you normally wear may not be ideal for backpacking; women will probably prefer a \"sport\" bra that provides more support and no hooks in the back, and men may find that briefs provide less opportunity for skin-to-skin chafing and bunched up fabric than boxers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Carry"]},"\n\nThere are two basic kinds of backpacks used in wilderness travel: ",{"type":"''","value":["internal frame and external frame."]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["external frame"]}," is the more traditional variety, consisting of a metal frame that's strapped to your hips and shoulders, and which your sleeping bag, tent, and the fabric pack itself are strapped to.  They're better for keeping your gear organized and accessible, and a bit cooler to wear, because they leave small gaps for air to move between you and the pack.  They're the best option for the heaviest loads.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Internal frame"]}," packs have become very popular in the last couple decades.  They use a more flexible frame built into the fabric of the pack itself, which allows you to carry the weight closer to your body, improving your balance.  One trade-off is the lack of back ventilation.  \n\nWith either kind of pack, be sure to adjust the straps to put as much weight as possible on your hips, rather than your shoulders.  The shoulder straps should mostly be keeping the pack from falling backward, not actually supporting its weight.  This will save lots of wear and tear on your back and shoulders, making for a much less painful trip.\n\nSome people prefer to bring along at least one of anything they might need, and others opt to travel more lightly, giving up convenience and comfort for mobility. But if your pack weighs more than a quarter of your body weight, it's too heavy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nYou'll want \"light\" meals, not in the sense of fat or calorie content, but in terms of how much the food weighs in your pack.  In fact, you may want to lay off a lot of your \"healthy diet\" habits for the duration of your trip, because you'll ",{"type":"''","value":["want"]}," those extra calories, and fats are a good compact source of all-day energy.  Wilderness camping is the very kind of lifestyle that led homo sapiens to develop a fondness for that kind of food.   Depending on the length of your trip, food could make up a substantial fraction of your pack weight (figure at least a pound or 450g per day).  Since water makes up a large percentage of the weight of most foods we eat, and presumably can be found along the way, the obvious solution is to pack foods you can \"just add water\" to.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Breakfast"]}," - Oatmeal is a good option: inexpensive, lightweight to carry, and easy to prepare.  Measure portions ahead of time into zipper-sealed baggies for more convenience.  Add a spoonful or two of brown sugar to make it more tasty."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lunch"]}," - You might welcome lunch as an excuse to stop to eat during the day, but preparing food on the trail can be a nuisance, so on-the-go foods like trail mix, granola or energy bars, or peanut butter are handy.  For short trips, or for the first day or two of longer trips, you can bring semi-perishable foods such as fresh fruit or bagels."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dinner"]}," - To restore your energy at the end of the day, freeze-dried foods are your most practical option.  All sorts of pre-prepared dishes are available, mostly combinations of noodles, rice, chunks of veggies and meat, and sauce.  Many can be prepared in the packaging they come in, making clean-up easier: just add boiling water, mix, and wait a few minutes.  Especially with the sauce of hunger added, they can be quite tasty."]},"\nSome campsites have fire pits or grills available for cooking.  If you use these, limit the wood you gather to small branches taken from the ground, not anything broken from trees (living or dead).  It's not as folksy, but it's more considerate of the environment to bring a small gas-powered camp stove with you: they're safer, more efficient, and don't require scavenging dry firewood from the wilderness you're there to admire.\n\nOther options include multifuel stoves. For longer trips, (where you would require more than one gas canister) provide better weight efficiency. They can also be refueled much more places, like a regular gas-station. If it is allowed to make backcountry fires in your area, skipping the stove may be an option. In general, there is plenty of wood in a forested backcountry area which is not heavily visited. A lot of food can be eaten without cooking also (like oatmeal and freezedrieds), if need be. When there has been rain, the only regular way of collecting dry wood for making the fire start is to break off dead branches on the bottom of pine trees. Birch bark is excellent to make the fire going, otherwise paper is a good alternative (do not burn plastic it creates a toxic smoke).\n\nKeep pots and pans to a minimum, both for weight and clean-up reasons.  If camping with someone you're in the habit of kissing, sharing a pot of food instead of dishing it out onto plates isn't a hygiene issue (but may become a ",{"type":"''","value":["relationship"]}," issue if you don't share equitably).  In fact, if you mix and eat your freeze-dried meals in the packages they came in, and your oatmeal in the baggies you packed it in, you can get away with just a single pan for heating water, which won't even have to be washed.  Stick to stewy and spoon-able entrés, and you may not even need to bring a fork or dinner knife.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Boiling Water?"],["If you are boiling water to kill bacteria and viruses, water should be brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute. At altitudes greater than 6,562 feet (greater than 2000 meters), you should boil water for 3 minutes.  Instead of boiling water in the morning before heading out on your hike, consider boiling water at night over a camp fire or camp stove right before bed. Storage of hot water in drinking bottles can give a head start in heating up a cold sleeping bag and will be refreshingly cold for drinking the next morning."]]},"\nBe prepared to drink more fluids than you're used to.  The reason overweight people sweat more than thinner people isn't just because they're well-insulated; it's because they're carrying around extra weight... just like a backpacker.  If you're at your ideal body weight but carrying a 40-pound pack, expect to sweat like someone 40 pounds overweight.  Walking for miles through the hills.\n\nYou might be able to pack all the water you'll need for short trips of a couple days, but not for anything longer.  Some areas will have wells that you can pump to refill your water supply.  In more remote areas, you'll have to collect water from lakes and streams.  Check with the local authorities to find out which water supplies they recommend, and what precautions to use with them.  Depending on which micro-organisms are common in the area's water supply, they may recommend using water purification tablets (a dose of poison strong enough to kill many bugs, but not affect humans), micropore water filters (usually pumped by hand), or boiling the water for several minutes.  Boiling isn't usually a problem for cooking water, but filtration or chemical treatment are less hassle for water you'll want cool enough for refreshing drinks as you hike.  Filtered water tastes best.\n\nDuring the days of much physical exercise — which is likely why you are out in the wilderness in the first place — your body loses not only water, but also a lot of sodium through perspiration. This is especially true in the hotter climates and the sodium loss can be just as serious as dehydration, but cannot be as easily noticed (some symptoms are having a loss of appetite and headaches). Drinking water does ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," restore sodium into your system; in fact it lowers sodium levels in your blood even further. In some countries, fortified sport drinks with high levels of sodium (and other electrolytes) are available, but keeping this fact in mind is of no use when you are three days' walk away from the nearest convenience store. One good way to replenish your body's sodium level is to have a soup that is a little bit saltier than you are used to at the end of each day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nLightweight synthetic insulating materials have been developed for sleeping bags in the last few decades, but old-fashioned down remains a good option.  Down still offers the most warmth for the least weight and it packs up more tightly than synthetic fill.  However it loses its warmth-keeping ability when it gets wet and takes longer to dry.  Down-filled bags last longer but are also more expensive.  Mummy-style bags will keep you warmer than rectangular ones (less space for your body to heat up) and take up less room in a tent, but don't plan on moving around much if your sleep in one.\n\nSleeping bags are typically rated for the coldest temperature in which they'll keep you warm enough.  If there are separate extreme and comfort ratings, the former is a guess about what an adult man would survive.  There are standards for these ratings, but the scale itself is something of a guess, since they don't know what your metabolism is like, how sensitive to cold you are, or for that matter what you'll be wearing to sleep in.  Select your bag based on the coldest temperature you can anticipate experiencing (remember that night temperatures is what counts).  If you can see yourself ever hiking in high altitudes, in high latitudes, or in spring or autumn, get a 3-season bag with a lower temperature rating.  And if there's ever a chance you'll see snow when you camp, get something in the 0°F (−20°C) range. Additionally inserting a simple \"hut sleeping bag\" – made of a single layer of silk (preferable) or other lightweight fabric – can really raise the temperature in your sleeping bag.\n\nThe fluff in a sleeping bag is only to keep the air inside warm, not for softness.  Cold ground can suck the heat out through the flattened underside of a bag as quickly as exposure to cold air would.  For these reasons, a thin insulating foam pad (inflatable pads compress smaller, but are susceptible to leaks) will make your nights more comfortable.  They won't come close to the softness of a mattress, however.  Instead of a pillow, try wrapping the clothes you aren't wearing in a towel, or your sleeping bag's stuff sack, and rest your head on that.  Or buy a travel pillow, which collapses into a tiny pouch.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\nSome backpacking areas have shelters along the trails, spaced at intervals a typical hiker can cover in a day.  If these are available, and the park authority lets you reserve them, you may be able to dispense with carrying a tent.  This doesn't mean you can use a lightweight indoor \"slumber party\" sleeping bag, though; even when these shelters are fully enclosed, they probably won't offer much protection from cooler night-time temperatures.\n\nIn areas with extreme temperatures there may be huts or shelters with stoves or fireplaces, enabling you to have a more comfortable temperature at night – but in these areas there is often a risk of snow storms or other circumstances that may hinder you from reaching the shelter.  At least you will be able to dry your equipment in the hut afterwards.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tent at High Shelf Camp.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["Tent at High Shelf Camp, near Mount Anne, Southwest National Park, Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, Tasmania, Australia"]]},"\nTents are available in many shapes, sizes, and levels of protection.  Some models (especially domes) can be free-standing, requiring no stakes to hold them in shape.  But they tend to be heavier, and trickier to set up.  Unless you're sure you're never going to get rained on, a tent with a \"rain fly\" – a water resistant raincoat for your tent – is essential (this is integrated in some tents).\n\nAt the small end of the scale is the \"bivy sack\", which is little more than a raincoat for your sleeping bag; the most spacious ones are just big enough inside to carefully roll over. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Important: a bivy bag is usually almost airtight and can cause suffocation if closed completely."]}," Additionally, a bivy bag does not allow for drying anything, like a regular tent. Since it is so small condensation from your breath will build up. As a consequence humidity will build up if you don't get the chance to dry anything. Such as in the case of prolonged (2 days) rain. Bivy bags are therefore great for shorter trips or if you are comfortable that the weather or area will provide some opportunities for drying, and are significantly lighter than even the smallest tent. \n\nA typical \"1-person\" tent might give you enough room inside to actually hunch over and maybe even scrunch up and turn around, but no more.  A \"2-person\" tent is going to be big enough for just that: two people, lying right side-by-side.  Depending on just how close you and your camping partner want to be, you might prefer a \"2-to-3-person\" tent (otherwise big enough for two adults and a child).  If you're thinking of a larger tent so you can keep your gear with you (whether for easier access or to keep it out of the weather), a tent with a vestibule or an extended rain fly might be all you really need.  By the time you get to a \"4-person\" tent, you're generally talking about something spacious enough that one or two people can sit upright in it, but heavy enough that you'll want to distribute the components among the people in your hiking party.\n\nAlthough tents will keep most of the wind out, and usually trap air well enough to keep it warmer than outside, don't count on them to keep you ",{"type":"''","value":["warm"]},"; that's your sleeping bag's job.
