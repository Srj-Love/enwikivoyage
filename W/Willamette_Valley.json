Its highly fertile soil drew the first American settlers to Oregon in the 1840s and it remains the center of population in the state. The valley is said to begin in the south at Eugene, where the McKenzie meets the Willamette River, which then meanders through the farmland past Albany, Independence, and Salem, reaching the head of navigation at the Falls in Oregon City, and thence through Portland to the Columbia River.\n\nIt has a Mediterranean climate, quite moderate in temperature.

July and August are especially dry and pleasant.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portland (Oregon)"],["Portland"]]}," is the state's only large metropolitan area and the center of much of its culture and economics.

As of 2013, there are over 300 individual wineries in this one region alone.  The climate, latitude, and geology is particularly suited to the production of top-quality Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Pinot Gris.\n\nA favorite local activity is wine tasting.  Most wineries have a public tasting room you can visit during the day to sample their lineup of wines for a modest tasting fee.  The tasting fee is often waived if you purchase a bottle or two.  The highest concentration of wineries is centered around the town of Dundee, but there are other pockets of wineries near Newberg, Carlton, McMinnville, Salem and Eugene.  \n\nSeveral online resources exist to help you plan a day of wine tasting in the Willamette Valley",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/willamettewines.com\/ [1",{"type":"<","value":["nowiki",["]"]]}]},{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/willamettewines.com\/winery-map\/ [2",{"type":"<","value":["nowiki",["]"]]}]},{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/willamettewines.com\/tours\/tour-companies\/ [3",{"type":"<","value":["nowiki",["]"]]}]},", and there are many food and lodging accommodations nearby to fulfill the needs of wine tourists.",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/willamettewines.com\/where-to-stay\/hotels-inns\/ [4",{"type":"<","value":["nowiki",["]"]]}]},{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/willamettewines.com\/where-to-eat\/ [5",{"type":"<","value":["nowiki",["]"]]}]},"\n\nWineries are open year-round but the high season is typically from June through October when the chance for rain is low and daytime temperatures are pleasant.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bend"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Oregon"]]},".
