Best plan is to start at Oliver Street Bar and Grill and then move on to the Overlander pub for dancing after 9pm.\n\nOliver Street Bar and Grill is an excellent place to eat and drink. The food is really good with a varied menu and the service is excellent.\n\nThe Overlander pub is a hub of activity on the weekend with great food and nightly specials don't miss Wednesday wing night either.\n\nIf you like dancing and would enjoy a night out on the town the Overlander pub offers good food, dancing and lots of young people out for a good time.\nLooking for a more laid back environment? Oliver Street has more of a sports bar atmosphere. While those looking for a casual evening out could try The Point located above Chances Casino or The Laughing Loon which was featured on HGTV's Timber Kings.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["placename=Williams Lake"],["image1=BC-97.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prince George"]]}],["minorl1=100 Mile House"],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kamloops"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["100 Mile House"]]}]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Cariboo-Chilcotin"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["52.1326"],["-122.1437"],["zoom=14"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Williams Lake, British Columbia"]]}]
