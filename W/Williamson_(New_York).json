It's a new venture from a long-time apple grower, DeFisher Fruit Farms, and, like most modern distilleries, has patterned itself much like a wineryâ€”tasting room and all.  The distillery's signature spirit is Tree Vodka, distilled from (no surprise) apples.  They also make drinks using pears, berries, peaches, and other fruit, but don't think that means they're laden with sugar; the sugar gets turned into alcohol during the distilling process."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Finger Lakes Apple Country"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["43.23"],["-77.19"],["zoom=14"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Williamson, New York"]]}]
