You will not find taxi cabs driving around waiting to pick patrons up.  If you need a cab, you will need to call one.  \n\nThe best way to get around Windham is by driving.  During the summer months, and height of the tourist season, traffic in North Windham can become backed up.  This is due to the fact that many people travel through Windham to Sebago Lake and Highland Lake.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nSebago Lake\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nSeacoast Funpark\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Bull Moose Music"]},", 771 Roosevelt Trail (Rt. 302) ",{"type":"''","value":["in a shopping plaza between Blockbuster Video and Subway Sandwiches"]},".
