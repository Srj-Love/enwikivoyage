Taxis primarily run between the townships and the main industrial\/commercial areas of the city. Routes are not fixed like a bus route or the combie routes in South Africa. This gives some added flexibility, but also means that fares between given destinations may not always be the same. You can get in or get out wherever you want along the \"route\".\n\nTo catch a taxi just flag it down by holding your arm out and waving your hand down towards the ground. It's a casual gesture, so don't stick your arm straight out like a sign post, and don't wave your arm around like you're calling for help. The fare for destinations that are on the \"route\" or close to the route is N$8, destinations more \"out of the way\" are charged at N$16. Non standard destinations cost around N$30. Tell the driver where you want to go when you get in or before you get in. If the destination is too far off their route, they will tell you they're not going there so you'll just have to wait for another taxi. This can be common during rush hour. It will take some time to figure out what these informal routes are.\n\nMost taxis cruise along Independence Avenue south of the intersection with Fidel Castro Street. The easiest place to catch them is in front of the Gustav Voigts Centre\/Kalahari Sands Hotel.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable taking shared taxis, there are ",{"type":"'''","value":["on-demand taxis"]}," which allow you to hire the entire car to yourself. Most of these taxis have to be pre-booked via telephone; they'll come and get you wherever you are. In the city, they can be found behind the Tourist Information Office at the intersection of Independence Avenue and Fidel Castro Street (opposite Gustav Voigts Centre\/Kalahari Sands Hotel) and on the northern-side of Wernhill Park shopping mall. They also tend to gather at popular restaurants and nightspots. Make sure you agree on the price before taking them; most will ask for at least N$50 to go anywhere around Windhoek. These taxis also can take you out of Windhoek, and especially to the airport; it's just a question of how much they are going to charge.\n\nHere are some taxi company numbers:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Lima Transfers:"]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["+264"]},"-(0)81-127-3232 (Eduard)"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Windhoek Namibia Robert Mugabe Avenue.JPG"],["thumb"],["Robert Mugabe Ave."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Parliament of Namibia"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Formerly the legislative assembly during the apartheid days, this is now the home of the National Assembly.
