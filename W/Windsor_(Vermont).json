Windsor was the site of the writing of the Constitution of the Republic of Vermont. Vermont was never a colony of England and was previously claimed land by NH and NY. Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys fought these states and formed their own republic on July 7, 1777, by signing a constitution that was the first to allow women rights and ban slavery. Vermont remained a Republic for 14 years when it was recognized by the United States and became the 14th state. The Constitution house, located on Route 5 North heading into town, has been restored and is open to the public. This historic building has moved from it's original location to where it sits today. Another historic building in this town is the Toll House; this is where tolls were originally collected after crossing the Covered Bridge over the Connecticut River.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Old Constitution House"]},", N Main, +1 802 674-6628."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=American Precision Museum"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.americanprecision.org"],["email="],["address=196 Main St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 802 674-5781"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Windsor is the home of interchangeable parts."]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cornish Colony Museum"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=147 Main St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 802 674-6008"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Features works of art by resident artists of the Cornish Colony.
