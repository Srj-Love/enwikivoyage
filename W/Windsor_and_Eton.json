Therefore it does not offer an entirely Shopping Centre based retail experience. It is more based around Peascod Street (the high street), King Edward Court, Thames Street, Windsor Royal Station and St Leonard's Road. In this case it has many, many different mixtures of independent fashion boutiques such as Michael Chell, Coco etc.; and of course large retail chains such as H&M, Monsoon and so on. It also has a variety of specialist retailers such as Molton Brown, Hotel Chocolat (extremely tasty handmade chocolate), Havana House Fine Cigar Merchants and Oil and Vinegar to name a few. There a far too many different shops that a visitor can step into, so they are not all named, instead take a walk through the places listed previously and enjoy the atmosphere of one of the most beautiful towns in England.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Windsor Royal Station Shopping Centre"],["url=http:\/\/www.windsorroyalshopping.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address=Goswell Hill, Windsor"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=opposite castle, near Windsor & Eton Central railway station"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-Sa 10AM-6PM Su 11AM-5PM"],["price="],["content=Shops, cafes and restaurants."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Windsor Royal Farm Shop"],["url=http:\/\/www.windsorfarmshop.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address=Datchet Road, Old Windsor"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+44 1753 623800"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-Sa 9AM-5PM Su 10AM-4PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=King Edward Court Shopping Centre"],["url="],["email="],["address=King Edward Court, Windsor"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Brand new shopping complex.

Expect queues on busy nights of the week and higher than average drinks prices! The arches are well worth a visit, the bars found here are housed inside old Victorian railway arches, which make them a really atmospheric choice and a great place to wind up or wind down - depending on your mood.\n \nThe edge of town, bottom of Peascod Street, just 2 minutes walk from the arches, is where you’ll find Windsor’s affluent residents socialising, cafe culture is certainly alive in this part of town,and in the summer months people spill onto the pedestrianised streets till very late 7 nights a week, it’s a great spot for people watching and unwinding from a day out. There is a good selection of restaurants to be found down here, probably the best in town, so well worth the short walk.
