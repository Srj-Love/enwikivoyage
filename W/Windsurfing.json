[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Windsurfing in Denmark banner Board sailing with shoreline background.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Windsurfing"]},", also known as sailboarding, funboarding or wave-sailing, is a popular sport activity involving a sail and surfboard to move above the water. Although it is a recognized Olympic sport since 1984, it mainly remains a non-competitive past-time in coastal areas. Obviously, windsurfing distinguishes itself from traditional surfing primarily through the use of a sail and the great dependence on wind. While modern boards have greatly increased the possibilities of other forms of surfing too, the arise of windsurfing first allowed boarders to ride extremely large waves. Apart from the ability to master extreme waves and reach high speeds (with records of over 90km\/h), windsurfers can also perform a wide range of freestyle moves, including jumps and spinning manoeuvres.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nAlthough the first known windsurfing board was developed as early as 1948, it was not until the eighties that popularity of the activity took a flight, making \"sailors\" or \"board heads\" (as windsurfers are usually called) a common beach sight. Although that popularity dropped somewhere in the nineties, a small revival seems to be taking place and plenty of destinations in the world offer a variety of windsurfing facilities. \n\nIt's easy to see that windsurfing combines characteristics of both traditional surfing and sailing. Although the sport requires the development of specific techniques, traditional surfing skills can make learning a bit easier. Many sailors in fact have pretty decent surfing skills too.\n\nAlthough wind conditions are a determining factor in windsurfing options, the right equipment allows sailors to move in wind speeds from near 0 to about 50 knots (>90km\/h). Beginners will usually take their first steps in very light winds of under 10 knots. Recreational sailors without professional gear generally prefer winds of 15 to 25 knots, which are perfect for skimming over the water (planing).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Equipment"]},"\nThe two main pieces needed for windsurfing are of course a board and a sail, although a number of accessories are standard equipment as well. As a rule of thumb, smaller boards and sails are used to reach higher speeds. Take into account that windsurfing equipment has been the subject of rapid developments over the past years, seriously improving user friendliness. Although it is quite possible to buy second hand pieces, carefully consider buying them if they are 3 years old or more, as you might miss out on new developments that make windsurfing easier. Of course, this is especially true for beginners.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Buy or rent?"]},"\nAnyone who is serious about windsurfing will soon desire their own gear, as it will best fit their needs. The choice between different kinds or sizes of sails and boards depends on the sailor's weight, skills and preferences, making it quite worthwhile to purchase pieces that match your interests. However, keep in mind that real beginners will take their first lessons on a beginner's board, which is more robust and designed to help you find balance. Therefore, consider renting at least your board and sail for your lessons (often the materials are even included in course prices). If you're at all serious about picking up the skills, you'll soon enough progress to higher levels, requiring different boards. It often pays off to discover your basic interests and preferences before making large investments in equipment you might have to abandon quickly as you develop your skills. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Basic pieces"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Sail - Sails vary in size, depending on the skill level and preferred activities of the sailor. Sailors engaging in high speed windsurfing or races typically use large sails of 6 to 15m2 in size. These sails are often \"camber\"-induced, which means that plastic pieces are placed in the sail to better keep it in an aerofoil shape. So-called \"wave sails\" are significantly smaller, usually measuring 3 to 6 m2. They are augmented too, making them suited to withstand strong waves. Free ride and freestyle sails have sizes somewhere in between, and are often the sail of choice for recreational sailors as they are fairly easy to handle and can be used for different purposes. Wave, free ride and freestyle sails are usually not camber-induced, but rather are so-called \"rotational sails\". They only maintain their aerofoil shape in a leeward position, when they catch full wind. In order to tack or jibe, these rotational sails need to flip from one to the other side of the mast."]},{"type":"*","value":["Board - Modern boards are usually under 3 meters in length, but they are usually measured in terms of volume and width. As with sails, skill level, weight and main activities of the sailor determine which board is most suited. As an indication, most wave and freestyle boards weigh no more than 7 kilos, while boards for beginners are significantly heavier, up to 15 kilos, to improve stability. Such boards for beginners are also equipped with a daggerboard."]},{"type":"*","value":["Mast and wishbone"]},{"type":"*","value":["Uphoal rope"]},{"type":"*","value":["Free-rotating joint to connect the rig (sail, mast and wishbone) to the board"]},{"type":"*","value":["Harness - Optional, attaches the sailor to the rig.

When moving in minor winds (<10 knots), the body of the board slides through the water using a fin and centreboard to maintain stability. This movement is very similar to the way a boat would make its way in still waters and is called \"sailing\". To steer, the board head moves the rig backward and forward, lowers the tail and\/or shifts his weight to a particular side of his board.\n\nIn stronger winds, the board no longer slides through the water, but starts skimming over the surface. This is called \"planing\", and allows the sailor to move forward at high speeds. For many sailors, planing is the most fun part of the sport. On top of the steering techniques used for sailing, the sailor will now also shift the rig and carve the water by pressuring an edge of the board. This way, the sailor can make tacking and jibing manoeuvres, much like a sail boat would in strong winds.\n\nSkilled sailors can engage in a range of disciplines and competitions, including freestyle, slalom, speed surfing and wave sailing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\nFor many, learning to windsurf may seem a tiring matter at first. Finding some balance and mastering the basic ways of steering in light winds will not necessarily take long, but the huge boards, tiny sails and low speeds that beginners will deal with can be a bit disappointing. Compared to other extreme sports, engaging in the more \"fun\" parts of the sport (e.g. planing at high speed) may require quite a lot of practice.\n\nFortunately, plenty of windsurfing schools exist in most suitable areas and equipment for beginners has been greatly improved in recent years. And of course, those that persist are rewarded with great water sports opportunities, for recreational or competitive activities.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Surfingmaui.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Exotic Maui is known for its fierce waves"]]},"\nThe basic conditions needed for windsurfing are rather simple.
