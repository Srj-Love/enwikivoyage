It also passed by the Nuuanu Pali lookout, a spectacular vantage point to view the Windward side. Inbound, the route provides the most direct route to downtown Honolulu. From Waikiki, take H-1 west to exit 21B (Pali Highway, route 61 north). From H-1 the route passes through the residential neighborhood of Nuuanu (with several traffic lights) for the first 3 miles.

Although H-3 allows for speeds as high as 60 mph (and is one of two stretches of highway in Hawaii where speed limits exceed 55 mph), from Waikiki the speed advantage is more than offset by the additional travel time required on H-1 and\/or H-201 to reach the Halawa interchange (Google Maps estimate from Waikiki to Kaneohe 30 minutes, to Kailua 33 minutes). Only recommended if the more direct routes are congested or closed, or if you are staying west of Pearl Harbor (e.g. at Ko Olina). From H-1 west, take exit 19B to H-201 west, then exit 1D from H-201 west to H-3 east. Take exit 9 or 11 from H-3 for Kaneohe; exit 11 or 14 for Kailua. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Other Routes:"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Kalanianaole Highway (Route 72):"]},", from southeast Honolulu, round the southeast corner of the island.
