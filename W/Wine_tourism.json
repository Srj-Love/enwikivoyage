Enotourism is a great way to learn about the people, culture, heritage, and customs of an area. Some of the famous wine producing regions of the world have been producing wine for centuries or even millennia, and the production and consumption of wine is deeply ingrained in the local culture.  Also, these areas tend to be off the beaten tourist track (although not that far off) so enotourism can expose travelers to new and interesting areas. Getting out and visiting wine producers provides contact with local farmers and artisans who care deeply about the area. Wine growers are farmers, and their perspective on the local area, and life in general, tends to be different from other locals typically encountered while traveling.\n\nFor the oenophile, enotourism is a wonderful way to better understand ",{"type":"''","value":["terroir"]},", the difficult to define concept that wine makers often use to describe a key component of their art. Roughly speaking, it has to do with how the quality of the land in which the grapes are grown affects the taste of the wine. Tasting wine at a wine shop or in the comfort of home can provide a hint at the ",{"type":"''","value":["terroir"]}," that produced the wine. But spending several days visiting the area, chatting with the wine makers and growers, and eating the local cuisine (which has evolved together with the wine for the two to perfectly complement each other) will provide an exceptional context for the wine and give deep insight into why and how the wine turned out the way it did.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See and do"]},"\nThe heart of enotourism is visiting wineries, and of course, tasting the wines.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Learn"]},"\nOne of the best ways to begin an adventure in enotourism is to attend wine classes at a respectable Wine School.

It is produced virtually everywhere in the country, and this means no matter where you are going, you can combine your next trip to Italy with a bit of enotourism.\n\nThat said, if you're going specifically for the wine, there are some regions that stand out.
