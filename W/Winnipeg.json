Winnipeg lies at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, a location currently known as The Forks. This point was at the crossroads of canoe routes travelled by Aboriginal peoples prior to European contact. Given its central location, Winnipeg started out as a fur trading post  Many trails converged on the city and later became streets (which is evident when you see the city's somewhat haphazard road layout).\n\nIn 1869–70, Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from Eastern Canada. This rebellion led to Manitoba's entry into the Canadian Confederation as Canada's fifth province in 1870. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city.\n\nAfter the construction of the CP railway across Canada, Winnipeg became a major transportation hub and \"Gateway to the West.\"  The city experienced a boom during the early 20th century and for while was Western Canada's major economic centre. Fortunately for the visitor, the economy slowed around the middle of the century, leaving intact a remarkable collection of period architecture, primarily in the city's downtown Exchange District.\n\nWinnipeg is off the tourist trail for most visitors to Canada, but the visitor will experience an authentic and friendly Canadian Prairie city which leaves many pleasantly surprised.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\n\nWinnipeg is generally a very tolerant city and was the first large city in North America to elect an openly gay mayor.

On-street parking, which ranges from $1–2\/hr can usually be found in popular areas if you are willing to search. Keep in mind that during rush hour, most of these spaces will turn into no stopping zones in order to facilitate traffic flow. If these are unavailable, there are parkades or parking lots which will provide a variety of hourly rates. These are roughly twice as expensive as street parking, but they are convenient and located all over the downtown area. If visiting The Forks, keep in mind that there is a large parkade and two lots which provide free parking for visitors.\n\nAuto theft is a serious problem in Winnipeg. Anti-theft devices are strongly recommended, especially immobilizers.

Some roads have bicycle lanes (shared with buses) and sharrows. Suggested cycling routes are marked by road signs, but may venture into residential areas with many stop signs. Riding on sidewalks is illegal, but this law is rarely enforced. The most problematic areas are typically bridges where no bicycle infrastructure exists, such as the Midtown Bridge and the Louise Bridge. Cyclists may be better off walking their bikes on the sidewalk on these bridges during rush hours. Bicycle theft is common throughout all areas of the city.

Many of these will follow along Winnipeg's rivers, making for a very scenic, but meandering, ride. Spring flooding may affect the conditions on routes near the rivers.

Major routes, especially downtown, will be cleared quickly and will have sand applied, which will help with safety but also make for a messy ride. These conditions will generally last from December to March. Bike paths and lanes may take much longer to be cleared, if they are cleared at all.

However, this pedestrian-unfriendliness is primarily perceived rather than real. Virtually all streets contain sidewalks on both sides running for the street's entire length and stoplight crossings are frequent even on highways.\n\nOne should note that walking across Portage & Main is prohibited and physically impeded by concrete barricades.
