Most people should have no problem walking anywhere they need to go.  Winooski is built on a hill, but most attractions are located downtown which is at the bottom of the hill.  There is a busy traffic circle at the center of town and pedestrians should be sure to use marked cross walks when crossing.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["On a bike"]},"\n\nCycling is also a good option for getting around the city. Some of the larger streets have bike lanes and traffic generally moves at low speeds.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Public Transportation"]},"\n\nWinooski is served by the Riverside and Essex Junction routes of CCTA.  Both provide access to downtown.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["In a Car"]}," \n\nFor a city of its size, getting around by car can be surprisingly difficult.  Parking can be hard to find at times and traffic moves particularly slowly at rush hour.  As the city is small in area, you are probably better off parking your vehicle and exploring the city on foot.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nWinooski has some classic New England mills located along the river.  They have all been converted into office space or housing, but the exteriors remain unchanged.  The Winooski River marks the southern border of the city and there are a set of rapids and a waterfall located just south of downtown.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Papa Frank's"],["url=http:\/\/www.papa-franks.com\/"],["email="],["address=13 West Center St."],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 802  655-2423"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Longtime residents love this place, but most likely for nostalgic reasons since it isn't particularly good compared with other Italian restaurants in the area.
