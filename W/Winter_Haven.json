Settled in the 1880s, Winter Haven became a transport hub for the citrus industry in the early 20th century. Eastern Polk county has long been among the top citrus-producing regions in the country. Since there are a few dozen lakes in and around the city, the Chain of Lakes project to link many of them by canals was begun in 1915. Most of the current canals were built during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps, although the original wood seawalls have rotted and been replaced by metal ones in recent years. In 1936, Cypress Gardens opened as the first commercial theme park in Florida. Cypress Gardens was famed for its water ski shows, Southern atmosphere, and lush gardens traversed by canals. The city was also home to Spring Training baseball, home to the Philadelphia Phillies (1928–1937), Boston Red Sox (1966–1992) and the Cleveland Indians (1993–2008). Cypress Gardens struggled financially and closed in 2003. Several successive owners added roller coasters and a water park, but it closed again in 2009 and was transformed into Legoland Florida, which opened in October 2011. The original botanical gardens (owned\/protected by the county) and the water ski show (a pirate-based one) have been incorporated into the new park and Southern belles—made of Legos, of course—have kept the memories of the original Cypress Gardens alive. Winter Haven remains a small suburban city, but Legoland, the Chain of Lakes, and the many other nearby attractions make it a nice destination.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 74"],["febhigh = 76"],["marhigh = 80"],["aprhigh = 84"],["mayhigh = 89"],["junhigh = 92"],["julhigh = 93"],["aughigh = 92"],["sephigh = 90"],["octhigh = 85"],["novhigh = 79"],["dechigh = 74"],["janlow = 51"],["feblow = 52"],["marlow = 56"],["aprlow = 60"],["maylow = 66"],["junlow = 71"],["jullow = 72"],["auglow = 73"],["seplow = 72"],["octlow = 66"],["novlow = 59"],["declow = 52"],["janprecip = 2.4"],["febprecip = 2.6"],["marprecip = 3.4"],["aprprecip = 2.2"],["mayprecip = 3.7"],["junprecip = 6.9"],["julprecip = 8.1"],["augprecip = 7.5"],["sepprecip = 6.2"],["octprecip = 2.6"],["novprecip = 2.4"],["decprecip = 2.2"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Winter Haven"],["28.03"],["-81.70"]]}]]},"\n\nWinter Haven was named for its temperate climate. The climate is much the same as the rest of Central Florida (except coasts). Winters are mild, with highs in the 70s (°F, 21-25°C) and lows in the 50s (°F, 10-15°C). Lows in the 30s (°F, 0-5°C) are common after cold fronts and there are usually a handful of lows below freezing each winter, although that requires clear skies, so it usually warms very rapidly after sunrise (30°F\/-1°C at 6AM, 55°F\/13°C by noon is typical). Cold fronts occasionally pass by as squall lines, so tornadoes in December or January are not unusual. Snow is rare; the last measurable snowfall was in 1977, although sleet\/wintry mix fell in an unusually cold January 2010. Summers are hot and humid, with highs around 95°F (35°C) and lows in the mid-70s (°F, 23-25°C). During the summer, onshore winds from both coasts travel inland, heat up, rise and build into thunderstorms, usually along a rough line. Lying in the center of the state, the line of storms (the \"seabreezes\") often collide and become severe, with tornadoes (small EF0-1s...not like powerful Plains ones), 50+ mph winds, and hail possible. Strong storms are usually preceded by cooler winds caused by the rain-cooled air (cold air sinks) rapidly flowing away from the storm. The temperature after a strong thunderstorm passes can drop from 95°F to 75°F (35°C to 24°C) and since the storms can be fairly small, you can drive 5 miles and the temperature will drop from 95°F to 75°F (35°C to 24°C).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Winter Haven Municipal Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["GIF"]]},") is located on the far northwest corner of town (near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Auburndale"]]},") and only handles general aviation.
