Door County is well known as a vacation destination for family outing (esp. family reunions) and its laid-back vacations.

As well, there is an active arts community with several galleries worthy of note like the Edgewood Orchard Gallery and the Potter's Wheel. \n\nNoah's Ark is \"America's largest Waterpark\" in Wisconsin Dells.

It was first sold at a Seymour, WI fair.\n\nFrozen custard is also a Wisconsin delicacy not found often outside the Midwest.  Frozen custard is similar to ice cream (it is NOT yogurt!).  It is unique in that there is far less air in it (making it less \"fluffy\" and far more smooth and creamy).  It contains egg, making it richer and creamier.  It has an inappropriate reputation as unhealthy relative to ice cream when in fact most frozen custards have less calories, less fat and less sugar, being less healthy only in that it has slightly more cholesterol than ice cream.\n\nWisconsin and the surrounding area is famous for its dairy products, and there are various regional specialties following this theme.

Until Pabst closed its Milwaukee brewery and began contracting out its production during the late 1990s Milwaukee was the brewing capital of the nation. Although only one major brewer (Miller) remains in the city, it's brewing heritage lives on in the large number of micro-breweries and brewpubs it has to offer.  Some more famous \"small\" breweries in Wisconsin include Point (located in the college town of Stevens Point), City (formerly G Heileman), New Glarus, Berghoff, Leinenkugels (in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chippewa Falls"]]},"), Riverwest and Sprecher (both from Milwaukee, the latter also makes many fine sodas).  Many restaurants and bars have their own local breweries inside the facility such that patrons can see the tanks as they eat.\n\nGrays Brewing is well known for its sodas also using real grain sugar (rather than the fine, processed sugar used almost everywhere else in all American food) which gives the flavor a unique and outstanding flavor.  Gray's makes primarily fruit-flavored sodas and reuses (not recycles) its bottles, so bring 'em back.\n\nPoint Brewing is now offering various sodas, including rootbeer, diet rootbeer, cream and other flavors. The tour of the brewery is said to be quite fun and extensive and concerts are held in the summer (Rock the Brewery).\n\nSprecher Brewing also is well known, and is gaining recognition nationwide, for its sodas, particularly its root beer and unique labels such as Orange Dream, Raven Red, etc.  A Root Beer or Orange Dream float with vanilla Frozen Custard is about the best beverage one can find. Tours are held Fridays and Saturdays all year-round, and everyday during the busy summer season. The cost of the tour is $4 for adults and $2 for those under 21. The price is well worth it, however, considering that the tour includes plenty of social time with unlimited samples of their sodas, and up to 4 samples of their beer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nWisconsin offers the usual assortment of chain motels, usually located just off the interstate highways, as well as a number of larger resorts.
