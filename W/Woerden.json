[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.woerden.nl\/ Woerden"]}]}," is a city and municipality in the Dutch province ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utrecht (province)"],["Utrecht"]]},". Woerden is located in the east of the Green Heart (",{"type":"''","value":["Groene Hart"]},") of the Netherlands, the green zone surrounded by the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Randstad"]]},". Outside built up areas, Woerden is mostly meadows and farmland. Woerden is located on the banks of the Old Rhine river, which used to be the main branch of the river Rhine until the 12th century. In Roman times, this river was the north border of the empire and an army unit was stationed where Woerden is now.\nThe municipality, which comprises other towns and villages in the neighbourhood (it's more than ten times the surface area of the city), has a population of about 50,000. The city of Woerden proper has about 34,000 inhabitants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nAround 40 AD, when the Old Rhine river (much bigger and wilder back then) was the north border of the Roman Empire, there was a castellum plus a small settlement at the current city centre's location, called Laurum or Laurium. Artifacts and even ships from that time have been found and some of them are exhibited in the parking garage appropriately called Castellum and in the city museum. Around 270 AD, German attacks made the Romans retreat from the castellum. In the Middle Ages, Woerden started flourishing again. A moat around the city was built, as well as city walls and later a castle. In 1372, Woerden received city rights.\n\nThe municipality of Woerden is very green and, like the rest of this part of the Netherlands, very flat, although the name Woerden derives from ",{"type":"''","value":["Wyrda"]},", as it was called in the Middle Ages, a word that exists in modern Dutch as ",{"type":"''","value":["wierde"]},", an artificial hill in the landscape, to be protected case of flooding. This hill is hardly visible however (the city centre is only about 2 meters higher than the surrounding area). The Old Rhine river is quite small, and hardly (if at all) used for shipping, small boats do use it for leisure purposes. The river crosses the city from east to west and around the city centre, splits and comes together to form a circular moat\/canal. The river used to cut across the city centre, but this middle branch was 'closed' (filled with earth and made into a street: the current ",{"type":"''","value":["Rijnstraat"]},"). The city centre is the oldest part of the city and stayed the only part until the 20th century. After the Second World War, the city started expanding to the east along the river and a new neighbourhood to the northwest. In later decades, the city extended to new neighbourhoods to the east and southwest. The latest addition is a new district in the southeast; building started in the 1990s and is ongoing.\n\nOther populated places in the municipality include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harmelen"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kamerik"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zegveld"]]},".

Starting at the castle (three o'clock on the ring), at goes through Plantsoen, Hoge Wal, Oostsingel (these three street are on top of the old city wall and aren't very interesting for pedestrians), then Meulmansweg, past the harbour and library, Kruittorenweg, past the windmill, Wilhelminaweg and finally Prins Hendrikkade. Because of the 'moat', there are only four roads out of\/into the city centre: the Oostdam in the east, near the castle, that leads to the train station. The Oostsingel in the north, the Westdam in the northwest (near the harbour) and the Oranjestraat in the southeast (near the mill).\n\nThere is a tourist information centre in the city museum (",{"type":"''","value":["Stadsmuseum"]},"): ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=TIP Woerden"],["url=http:\/\/www.toerisme-woerden.nl\/"],["email=info@toerisme-woerden.nl"],["address=Kerkplein 6"],["lat=52.086081"],["long=4.884545"],["directions=next to the Petrus church"],["phone=+31 348 431008"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Tue-Sat 10am-5pm, Sun 1pm-5pm, Mon closed"],["price="],["content="]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nWoerden has an \"intercity\" train station, direct trains run from and to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["The Hague"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rotterdam"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utrecht"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gouda"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leiden"]]},".

From the international airport Schiphol near Amsterdam, Woerden can be reached by train, by changing in either Leiden, Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena or Utrecht. The train station is located very close to the city centre. Woerden is not serviced by night trains; trains only run from 5-6am to midnight-1am (depending on the destination). If you want to reach Woerden by public transport outside these hours, take a night train to Utrecht and from there a night bus or a taxi to Woerden.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nWoerden's main bus station is located next to the train station, on the north side (city centre side). A smaller hub is located at the south side of the train station.

The OV-Reiskaartje costs €2.50 on the bus and is valid for 45 minutes.\n\nThere is a taxi stand in front of the train station, although often there are no taxis there.

Rent a bicycle at the train station for about €7 per day. Bike theft is not as common as it is in larger cities like Amsterdam and Utrecht, but a reasonable lock is still quite necessary.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nWoerden has its own ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":Wikipedia:nl:Kasteel van Woerden"],["castle"]]},", probably built in 1410 by Duke John the Pitiless of Bavaria-Straubing. It's located at the east side of the city centre, it can't be missed when coming from the train station to the city centre. The castle currently houses some restaurants, several function rooms and some companies and it's possible to cross the bridge over the moat to the small courtyard when the restaurants are open.\n\nIf you like churches, Woerden has several in its centre: the catholic Bonuventura Church at the east end of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Rijnstraat"]},", it's neogothic, built in 1892 and the tallest church in Woerden. The Dutch reformed Petrus Church on the ",{"type":"''","value":["Kerkplein"]}," (\"Church Square\") is gothic, built in the 13th and 14th century.
