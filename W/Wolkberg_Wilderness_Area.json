Along the way are signs to the Serala State Forest (possibly the old name of the wilderness area). About 300 metres before the office, the road forks. Take the left fork.

The east-west section of the track crosses the river numerous times. Many of the drifts \/ small bridges have been washed away but can be negotiated in a good 4wd vehicle.

There are some jeep tracks and paths. Around the Serala peak there are quite a few paths. The area south of the Wonderwoud is less visited. The bush tends to be rather dense which makes it difficult to get up to the plateaus, so below are some rough indications of trails that are easy to follow. The coordinates are from Google Earth. \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Southern East-West Jeep Track"]},"\nJeep track along the southern section of the river. The track is parallel with the river in an east-west direction. \n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Path to Southern Plateau"]},"\nAt 24°05′41.07″S 30°04′00.72″E, a valley leads from the jeep track up to the southern plateau. A small stream flows in the center of the valley. The stream flows into the Mohlapitse river. \n\nA good place to enter the valley (to avoid the dense bush) is the point where the stream meets the jeep track. Near the jeep track the stream becomes wider and it is difficult to pin point an exact location. The area where the stream crosses the jeep track is muddy. One should try to enter the valley on the eastern side (of the valley-opening at the jeep track, just before the stream).\n\nFor the first 500m the path stays close to the stream. Initially the path goes up on the western side, then crosses east and finally crosses west again to a clearing. The clearing provides plenty of camping space. This is also the last point before the plateau to get water. From here the path follows the dry river bed of the stream for about 1.1 km. At this point the path leaves the stream on the western side and moves up a grassy slope in a north-westerly direction to the top of the plateau. The slope is covered in long grass and trees but there is no thick bush.\n\nNear the jeep track the stream contains water, however after about half a kilometer the stream is dry. The nearest stream is on the plateau (about 4 km). \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Klipdraai to Waterfall at Ceylon"]},"\nTwo waterfalls at about 24°03′54.10″S 30°01′36.75″E.\n\nLots of space to camp at river.\n\nJeep track leading from Klipdraai to waterfall.\n\nPath leading north from waterfall along river.\n\nFaint path leading up to the Ceylon ridges at 24°03′37.46″S 30°02′06.29″E.

Walking along the ridges leads to the southern plateau. This section explains one possible way to the top of the ridges. This is not the only path up, it is not necessarily the best and it is not the safest.\n\nWhen walking to Y from the waterfall, one can see the top of the southern ridges. Aim for about 24°04′09.28″S 30°03′02.64″E. Once at Y, in theory it is possible to beat a direct path to the top. Through the thick bush, this is fairly exhausting. Alternatively, walk north up the small stream for between 100m and 200m. This involves boulder hopping and ducking branches and vines. Then head directly up the mountain slope in a easterly direction to just below the cliffs. Initially the bush is thick. A little further up, the slopes are steep but covered by grass and trees. Once at the cliffs move south along the cliffs (the path south along the cliffs is steep and the ground is lose) till an opening leads to the top of the ridges.\n\nThere is no water for 1.5km from the small stream till the stream flowing down the top of the southern plateau.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Y to Corner"]},"\nNot sure if it is possible to walk from Y to Corner.
