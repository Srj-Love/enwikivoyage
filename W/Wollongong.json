Its growth was limited by mountains, which are not so much high as steep, and the sea, Wollongong has grown to include a whole chain of coastal towns, from Dapto and Port Kembla in the south to Bulli, Austinmer, and even up to Stanwell Park in the north. Continuous development has recently stretched the urban area along the coast as far as Kiama in the distant south but those areas are serviced by the growing centre of Shellharbour.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Industry"]},"\n\nIts modern origins are in coal mining and steel production, industries which persist, notably the BlueScope steel facility at Port Kembla to the south. A dedicated port exists for the transport of materials whereas private craft and fishing boats use a separate facility nearer the city centre in Belmore Basin. New industries, such as financial services, information technology, tourism and education are fast becoming trademarks of the city.  Wollongong people are proud of the employment and heavy industry in the area, and choose to be more than just a outer commuter suburb for Sydney.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Community "]},"\n\nThe University of Wollongong is popular with local, other Australian and international students. Due to post war migration involving heavy industry, Wollongong also includes a large Mediterranean (Macedonian, Serbian, Bosnian, Crotian, Italian, Hungarian, Greek, Turkish, Portuguese, Spanish), Indian and Asian population which has left its mark on the city and means there is a great range of food and entertainment options.\n \nThere are many interesting and beautiful locations within easy reach.

Expect to take longer in the afternoon peak, Wollongong is a part of the Sydney commuter belt.\n\nIf you have a little longer, you can take a route via the Bulli Pass and the Wollongong Northern Beaches.  At the end of the freeway the Bulli Pass road throws itself straight down the escarpment and along the coast.  The exit is well signposted after the end of the freeway.
