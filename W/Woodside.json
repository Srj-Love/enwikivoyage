On weekends, Alice's is the destination for hundreds if not thousands of bicyclists and motorcyclists who enjoy riding the well-maintained and twisty roads in the area. It's not unusual on a Sunday Morning to see dozens of motorcycles ranging from restored antiques to the newest and fastest sportbikes, all polished up for an informal bike show. To motorcyclists, \"Alice's\" actually refers both to the restaurant and to the Skywood Trading Post, a general store with a coffeepot and a deli directly across Skyline Boulevard. The parking lots on both sides of the street are full of bikes, bikers, and the curious almost every weekend."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Alice's Restaurant"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/alicesrestaurant.com"],["email="],["address=17288 Skyline Blvd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=At the crossroads of Routes 35 and 84 (Skyline Blvd. and La Honda Rd.)
