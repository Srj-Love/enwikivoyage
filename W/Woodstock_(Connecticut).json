The population was 7,221 at the 2000 census.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nIt is the second largest town in Connecticut (note: towns in New England are legally distinct from cities, and there are quite a few cities in Connecticut that are much larger than Woodstock), but it is tranquil and quiet. There is a large farming community, with the most operating dairy farms in the state and gorgeous views from throughout the town. \n\nWoodstock is an incredibly historic, rural, and agricultural area. It is not a commercialized area, with most of the businesses being locally run.\n\nWoodstock has a solid selection of different camps and parks, fitting in with the rural atmosphere and beautiful scenery.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nIn the mid-17th century, John Eliot, a Puritan missionary to the Indians, established \"praying towns\" where Native Americans took up Christianity and were expected to renounce their religious ceremonies, traditional dress, and customs. One Praying town, called Wabaquasset (Senexet, Wabiquisset), 6 miles west of the Quinebaug River in present-day Woodstock, was the largest of the three northeastern Connecticut praying towns.\n\nIn 1675, when King Philip's War broke out, some of the town's Indians, (especially in the southern part of the town) sided with the Mohegans and the English while others sided with the Indians led by Philip, rallying to arms on what is now Curtis Island in present Holland, Massachusetts and Brimfield, Massachusetts. During the war, the Praying town became deserted, and the English with their Indian allies marched through Woodstock to present day Thompson in the summer of 1676 burning any crops or stored corn they could find.\n\nIn 1682, Massachusetts bought a tract of land, which included Woodstock, from the Mohegans. A group of 13 men from Roxbury, Mass. (home of the Pastorate of Woodstock's earlier visitor, John Eliot), settled the town in 1686 and named it New Roxbury. Judge Samuel Sewall suggested the town change its name to Woodstock in 1690, and in 1749 the town became part of Connecticut.\n\nA farming town in the 18th century, Woodstock began attracting industry after the War of 1812. \"By 1820, there were 2 distilleries, 2 wheel wrights, an oil mill, fulling mill, carding machines, grist mills, saw mills, a goldsmith, and twine and cotton batting operations. Woodstock Valley was known for its shoe factories,\" according to the history page at the Woodstock town government Web site.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, industry almost ceased, and Woodstock reverted back to a rural state. The town then became a summer destination for wealthy city dwellers from around the East coast of the United States.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 61.8 square miles (160.1 km²), of which 60.5 square miles (156.8 km²) is land and 1.3 square miles (3.4 km² or 2.10%) is water.

Grant bowled his first strike in the bowling alley located in the carriage barn.  The pink colored house features \"tall, angular gables, gingerbread trim, and 21 formal flower gardens outlined by dwarf boxwood hedges,\" according to a Hartford Courant article. Roseland is an example of Victorian Gothic Revival style, which can be seen in its pointed gables, scrolled bargeboards, many tall chimneys, and leaded glass windows in diamond shapes. The outside walls, of board and batten wood siding, have been painted 13 different colors over the past 150 years -- all shades of pink (as of the summer of 2006 the house was a coral or salmon color). The house still has the owners' original furniture and knickknacks.  Roseland was designed (under Bowen's direction) by architect Joseph C. Wells. The design was influenced by the architectural design books of architectural critic Andrew Jackson Downing.
