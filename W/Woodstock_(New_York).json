It has been a center for the arts for a full century, and even the police cars have a logo that says \"Colony of the Arts.\"\n\nWoodstock, at an altitude of 520 feet, sits among the Catskill mountains, and is a picturesque village without a single traffic light, whose shops largely cater to tourists and spread out only along a few blocks. Weekends and especially summer weekends find it crowded with visitors, while hippy-types play drums continuously in the village green. Actual year round residents number only 5,000 -- and this includes outlying hamlets such as Lake Hill and Willow, all of which are beautifully unpolluted and tranquil.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n;By car\n",{"type":"*","value":[" from the South, NYS Thruway Exit 19 (Kingston), State Route 28 West, State Route 375 North, State Route 212 West leads to the green at the center of Woodstock."]},{"type":"*","value":[" from the North, NYS Thruway Exit 20 (Saugerties), State Route 212 West leads to the green at the center of Woodstock."]},"\n;By bus: Frequent daily buses North from New York City and South from Oneonta.\n\n;By train\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Amtrak to Rhinecliffe in Dutchess County and taxi from there."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Amtrak or MetroNorth to Poughkeepsie and taxi from there."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Bearsville Theatre"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.bearsvilletheater.com"],["email="],["address=291 Tinker St. (Route 212) Bearsville"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 845-679-4406"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Stage for live musicians, radio station and restaurants adjacent."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=River Rock Health Spa"],["url=http:\/\/www.riverrock.biz"],["email="],["address=62 Ricks Road"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Between Route 212 & Glasco Turnpike"],["phone = +1 845-679-7800"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=year-round, closed Tue-Wed"],["price="],["content=Health and beauty spa devoted to natural wellness.
