Worcester is the county town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Worcestershire"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nWorcester started life as a Roman period settlement. It is famous for the part it played in the English Civil Wars: the scene of some of the decisive battles, and of Prince Charles' escape, after in his defeat. Parts of the town still have buildings from this period, particularly Friar Street.\n\nIt has pleasant river walks, a medieval cathedral and the ruins of monastic cloisters. The medieval city walls remain in traces. Around the cathedral are picturesque Georgian residences.\n\nWorcester is actually the ancestral home of the famous Lea and Perrins Worcestershire sauce. It's produced by the Heinz Corporation on its factory on Midlands Road in the city, where it has been produced since 1897. Worcester is also the home of one of England's better known county cricket teams.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Town planners"]},"\nThe city was heavily renovated during the 60s and 70s and not very sympathetically. Numerous old roads and courtyards were demolished. The last cathedral lychgate in England was demolished along with Sir Edward Elgar's shop to make way for a charmless hotel and a multi-storey car park. This is known locally as \"The Rape of Worcester\". However this overlooks the fact that many of the old buildings were little better than slums and were deeply unpleasant. Nevertheless, a look at old OS maps shows that the city centre was perforated by intricate old 'courts' which were almost all removed. A few wide roads were driven into the city to facilitate easy traffic movements. A feature of today's city is that many roads have historic buildings on one side and modern ones on the other due to road widening. Even the remaining historic roads are superficial - for example Friar Street has many beautiful buildings but look behind them and you'll see the concrete backs of nearby buildings. Having said all this, Worcester is a pleasant city which is safe and relaxed. More recent development is a lot more sympathetic, if a little conservative. There are still many interesting things to see and these are taken advantage of by several guided walks offered through the local tourist centre.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Orientation "]},"\nThe ancient city of Worcester is on the east bank of the River Severn.  As the city's boundaries were redefined in modern times it has come to encompass the village of St. Johns, which is on the opposite bank.  From the M5 motorway it is accessed either from Junction 6 (when approaching from the North), or Junction 7 (when travelling from the South).\n\nThe main axis of the city runs roughly North to South.  The Cathedral sits at the southern end of the High Street (now pedestrianised).  As you proceed North from the Cathedral you will walk along the High Street which is the main shopping street in the city.  Where this becomes a road again (at the taxi rank) it's name changes to The Cross, and it's name then changes (again) to Foregate Street (where one of Worcester's railway stations is located).  Continuing Northwards, the street changes it's name (again) to the Tything where Castle Street joins it and is also known as the A38 trunk road.  The road then goes through several more name changes before it reaches the limits of the modern city about 2 miles from the city centre.\n\nTo the east of the High Street, and running parallel to it, is the Shambles, another pedestrianised shopping street.  To the east of the Shambles is New Street, which going southwards, becomes Friar Street. Both of these streets are amongst the most picturesque streets (as long as you ignore the concrete circular ramp that disgorges from the mutlistorey car park into Friar street).  Broad Street runs westwards from where the High Street becomes The Cross and runs down to the only road bridge across the Severn in the city.\n\nIt is important to realise that there is only the one road bridge across the river as it dictates the rather confusing one way system.  At rush hour (and if the M5 motorway is closed) it is usually quicker walking around Worcester than driving!  There is also a railway bridge, and two foot bridges.  The first one, the Sabrina Bridge, is about 500m north of the road bridge just before the Racecourse stadium.  A new foot bridge was opened in 2010 about a mile to the south of the Cathedral.\n\nThe area to the South east of the cathedral is known as Sidbury and is effectively the end of the city centre.  Just after the Commandery the road forks - the lefthand fork, London Road (A44), heads South eastwards towards the motorway network, and the other fork heads towards Tewkesbury (as Commandery Road\/Bath Road\/A38).  On the river Severn, about half a mile south of the Cathedral is Diglis Basin where the Worcester and Birmingham canal terminates and joins the river Severn.  The warehouses, factories and wharfs in this area had fallen into severe dereliction, but most are now converted into apartments (though some are still in progress).  The basin itself is now the home to large number of canal boats and other leisure craft and, particularly on a sunny day, makes for a pleasant stroll around.  Currently this area lacks facilities - there is the Anchor pub, and not far away the Diglis Hotel.  The lanes around Diglis are a labyrinth to strangers - the easiest way to get to it is to walk down the canal path from the Commandery (at the Commandery walk to the canal lock, and facing the lock turn left under the road bridge).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nLondon Heathrow Airport is linked directly to Worcester by a twice daily National Express Coach service.

The A417\/A419 is mainly good dual carriageway, but there are a couple of miles of single carriageway road near the \"Air Balloon\" pub which can be rather congested at peak times.

The corresponding bus is number W1 and runs every 10 to 15 minutes throughout the day and takes about 10 minutes to reach the city centre.  It stops at a limited number of stops en route, but one of them is Foregate Street railway station.  The standard charge is £2.20 per person (which includes all day parking).  A group ticket is also available for up to 7 people in the same vehicle and costs £3.50 in total.  For under 19s the charge is £1.  All  tickets are available on board the bus or from a ticket machine at the car park.\nFor full details see the City Council's website about Park and Ride: http:\/\/worcestershire.whub.org.uk\/cms\/park-and-ride.aspx\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Train"]},"\n\nWorcester has two train stations, Worcester Shrub Hill and Worcester Foregate Street, Foregate Street Station is the closest to the town centre. Shrub Hill is easier for cars to access, as Foregate Street has no parking available.\n\nWorcester is not on the main railway line between Bristol to Birmingham, but on a slower side line. It does have regular trains to Reading and London Paddington. The journey takes approximately 2 1\/4 hours. Its also within easy reach from Cheltenham, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gloucester, The Malvern Hills, Evesham, Oxford, Hereford etc. Trains come on a relatively regular schedule.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bus"]},"\n\nThe Bus Station is situated at the bottom of CrownGate Shopping Centre.

",{"type":"''","value":["Note: the area around South Quay is being refurbished and is not due to reopen to the public until late May 2011."]},"\n\nThe river bank by South Quay is a popular area to stroll and pass away some time.   There are fountains set in the pavement near Brown’s restaurant, and usually a large number of swans congregate on the river nearby as they rely on the steady stream of visitors to feed them.  Continuing south down the footpath you will come across Watergate (with marks on the wall to record the heights reached by various floods since the 17th century).  Passing through Watergate will take you up into College Green and the cathedral environs.  Carrying on along the river path will take you towards Diglis basin, and then, about a mile south of the Cathedral, Diglis Lock (a set of large locks on the river) and the new foot bridge.   The area on the east bank of the river leading up to the new footbridge is a derelict industrial wasteland awaiting it’s turn for re-development.  However crossing over the footbridge and heading north takes you along a leafy path through fields up to the main bridge.  On certain days during the summer a rowing boat acts as a ferry across the river near the Watergate.\n\nAn alternative is to head north along North Quay and under the railway viaduct.  This isn’t initially so visually pleasing as the area is host to a number of car parks and across the river is  a prominent car hire firm based in a redundant petrol station.  However as you pass under the railway bridge you will reach the race course (an area known as Pitchcroft).  Just before the stadium itself you can cross the river using the Sabrina bridge and turn South again back to the main bridge (you can head North and continue along the Severn Way footpath, but there are no more crossing points until Holt Bridge many miles to the North).  Alternatively you can stay on the East bank and continue to walk along Pitchcroft – as you leave the race course stadium area the path is between a splendid row of mature trees and it is possible to walk a loop around Pitchcroft.  The trees on the eastern side have fallen victims to disease and many have been removed - many of their replacements however ‘drowned’ in the prolonged summer floods of 2007.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.worcester.ac.uk University of Worcester"]}]},".
