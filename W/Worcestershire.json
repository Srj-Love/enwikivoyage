The North also has the Lickey Hills and Waverley Hills, both of which are popular with urban residents as places to spend a family day out.\n\nThe west of the county tends to be hillier, and more wooded, as it borders onto Herefordshire and Shropshire. In the south west, the Malvern Hills offer great views and interesting ridge walks. The Malvern Hills can be seen from high points around most of the county.\n\nThere are a number of small, historic market towns, that made money from wool in the Middle Ages, but went into decline later. These towns can have very interesting mixes of buildings, from the Tudor and Elizabethan half timbered styles, through to Georgian and Victorian buildings in their town centres. Some, like Pershore, also have some monastic ruins. The Severn and Avon rivers also make for pleasant walks in several Worcestershire towns.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nBewdley Museum - Resident crafts people, fascinating indoor & outdoor displays, daily traditional craft deomonstrations, varied events, activities & exhibitions.
