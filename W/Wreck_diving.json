Most wreck diving is done on shipwrecks, but wrecks of aircraft are also commonly explored by scuba divers.  There are also a lesser number of more exotic wrecks which are dived upon, ranging from trains and buses to collapsed naval radar stations.\n\nAll scuba divers require some form of training, but many divers engage in additional training before diving on wrecks.

When penetrating a shipwreck, all equipment should be clipped in and secured close to the diver's body to stay streamlined. The clips used should be of a type which can not accidentally clip onto a line (those are known as suicide clips by cave divers), or should be weak enough to be broken free if they get snagged.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nIn addition to general safety advice relating to diving (as to which, see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scuba diving#Stay safe"],["Scuba diving - stay safe"]]},") wreck divers face a number of hazards in addition to those present in conventional scuba diving.  Overhead environments may prevent direct access to the surface.  Sharp edges may be present on the wreck.  Some wartime shipwrecks may contain explosive cargos, and some wrecks may contain toxic materials or pollutants.  Wrecks are also a magnet for fisherman, due to the fish that often gather on them, and fishing line and nets may become snagged on the wreck and present an entanglement risk for divers.\n\nMost wrecks are slowly disintegrating. The structure becomes weaker as the material corrodes or rots, and at some stage it will collapse. This is not a good time to be inside. Those wrecks which are exposed to rough sea conditions will generally deteriorate faster, but oddly enough, are also usually less of a risk for collapsing on divers, as this usually happens during a storm when no divers are around. The wrecks that are below the wave action are the ones which are more likely to collapse without warning, possibly when an unlucky diver bumps againat a critically weakened structure, and precipitates a collapse. This is very unusual, but remains a possibility, and is one of the reasons why divers should be adequately trained before attempting penetrations — it helps if you can recognise some of the signs of impending structural failure.\n\nIn conditions of poor visibility it is possible to accidentally penetrate some wrecks. If you are lucky, you will also accidentally find your way out again. If you are suitably skilled, you may also find your way out. When diving at a site where this is a possibility, it is prudent to tow a surface marker buoy on a line, or tie off a line at a point known to be outside the wreck before venturing too close in the darkness. Your line is the only guarantee of a way out.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Basic safety precautions"]},"\n\nAll diving involving overhead environments is inherently more risky.

Deeper waters means more nitrogen narcosis - divers need to have their wits about them inside high risk environments.  Stay within your limits. Use Helium based gases for deeper dives if you can.

If you are penetrating beyond the zone where surface light can reach, divers are trained to carry at least ",{"type":"''","value":["three"]}," battery operated lights.  It is no fun to be stuck in the middle of a shipwreck unable to see with a diminishing air reserve, though if properly trained, and using a guideline, it should not be a big problem to find your way out.

In the past, many areas have had a culture of artefact removal from wrecks, but more recently there has been far greater emphasis on preserving the historical nature of the wrecks.  Many countries now impose stiff criminal penalties on divers who remove artefacts.  Other wrecks have suffered over the years due to heavy usage by divers and the resultant accidental impacts.  \n\nAlthough increasingly less common, some wrecks which attract divers still contain human remains.  Divers are well advised to respect the last resting place of the people who perished when the vessel sank.\n\nDivers should strive to abide by the following basic guidelines when on wrecks:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Look but don't touch"]},", nature will eventually grind each shipwreck away into rust - there is no need to accelerate the process.
