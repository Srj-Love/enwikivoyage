In Australia, a small settlement like this is known as a ",{"type":"''","value":["roadhouse"]},", a service stop for petrol, food and accommodation for long drives through the Outback.\n\nBut Wycliffe Well is not just another roadhouse — it is the self-proclaimed ",{"type":"'''","value":["UFO Capital of Australia"]},". According to its own brochure, \"UFO sightings are so common, that if you stayed up all night looking, you would be considered unlucky not to see anything, rather than lucky to see something\". It's unbelievably cheesy, but the local restaurant is filled with newspaper clippings and images to persuade sceptical visitors. For its remote location, it is remarkable that it also boasts one of the largest selections of beer in the Northern Territory.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe summers in Wycliffe Well are known for their intense heat. Expect temperatures to be around 35°C at daytime and around 21°C at night time. Fortunately all the rooms have air-conditioning! The winters are easier to comprehend with daytime temperatures around 20°C, but it doesn't cool down much at night with temperatures hovering around 15°C.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThere are two ways to get in: either from the north or from the south on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Stuart Highway"]},".

Every day the bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alice Springs"]]}," leaves at 7:30PM to arrive about 5 hours later at Wycliffe Well. From Darwin, the coach leaves exactly at noon, passes Katherine at 5:25PM and arrives at Wycliffe Well around 4:45AM.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nWalk.

In fact, according to ",{"type":"''","value":["The Sun Herald"]},", it is ranked fifth for top reported UFO activity in the whole world. It all started during World War II, when servicemen who stayed at Wycliffe Well kept records in an old bindered book of nightly-seen unidentified objects. This book used to be on the front counter of the local restaurant for everyone to see, but has been stolen in 1990. Since then a new book is kept which includes possible sightings from the early 1990s. It's quite fun to browse through the logs filled with details of claimed sightings.\n\nIf you get tired of all the alien encounters, you might want to appreciate the stunning ",{"type":"'''","value":["sunrises and sunsets"]},". The sky of the Northern Territory is known the world over, and Wycliffe Well proves no exception. Get up early or stay up late and you'll be able to make beautiful pictures of the sun. Due to the small amount of lighting at night time, you can see an amazing amount of stars in the sky (but the front lights of the occasional ",{"type":"''","value":["road train"]}," might ruin your view).\n\nAnother sight is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wycliffe Well Railway"]},". This sugar cane train originally from the state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Victoria (state)"],["Victoria"]]}," has been relocated to Wycliffe Well in 1998.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nIt is only a 300 metre walk from the settlement to the nearby ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lake Wycliffe"]},". It is a 10-acre man-made recreational lake that holds about 150 million litres of water. As of 2008, the lake is still under construction, but ask the staff that you want to see the project and its construction and they will bring you there.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThere's not much for sale in Wycliffe Well beyond walls of UFO-related souvenirs — this settlement basically exists for buying basic amenities. So fill up your car with petrol, water, food and drinks, because you still have a long way to go through the Outback.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe restaurant is quite large compared to the size of the settlement, it has a total of 300 seats for all its visitors. There's some excellent crab and other seafood to be had here, thanks to the lakes nearby. Mains $16-25.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nWycliffe Well's local restaurant boasts some of the largest selections of beer in the Northern Territory — about 300 different labels when fully stocked. Just try some brands you've never had before and have a chat with the locals. The nightlife usually consists of a free country and western sing-along, so you better prepare your singing skills while driving down here...\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThere is only one accommodation in the settlement, the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wycliffe.com.au\/accommodation\/rates08-09\/accom_overview.htm Wycliffe Well Holiday Park"]}]}," (tel. +61 (8) 8964 1966).
