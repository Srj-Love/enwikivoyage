The Kimberley's oldest town has had a turbulent history of boom and bust that, along with the striking surrounding landscape, has shaped it into an destination more interesting than many think.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nWyndham sits on the Cambridge Gulf near the confluence of five rivers; the Durack, Pentecost, King, Forrest and Ord Rivers. Spreading itself around the base of the Erskine Range (known to locals as ",{"type":"''","value":["The Bastian"]},") on the edge of an expansive mud flat, the town is split into two main areas, the historical portside township and the residential Three Mile. Excepting the grandiose landscape, its attractions are decidedly low key, but anyone with an interest in history will find many relics connecting with West Australia's pioneering past.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe town was established in 1885 as a major port for the East Kimberley to support gold mining at Halls Creek. Wyndham quickly boomed as ships brought in waves of miners heading off to the Halls Creek goldfields to seek their fortunes.\n\nBy 1888 the gold at Halls Creek dwindled and with it, the fortunes of Wyndham. The town became a minor service centre for the  growing pastoral industry around the Ord river. By 1912 Wyndham's economy was virtually non-existent.\n\nIn 1913 the government began building the Wyndham Meatworks to restart the town's economy. World War I disrupted construction and it was finally completed in 1919. The meatworks was the lifeblood of the town's economy until its closure in 1985. With it many businesses departed to nearby Kununurra.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["The sinking of the Koolama"]},"\nIn 1945, near the end of World War II, the port became the site for one of WA's most curious naval incidents. The MV Koolama, a one time cruise ship requisitioned to transport soldiers into Indonesia and East Timor for the battle against the Japanese, was struck by Japanese bomber planes as it sailed from Broome toward Wyndham. Mangled by three bombs, it was beached off a remote part of coast, far from any town, where some of the ships 160 passengers and crew bailed into lifeboats and headed to a sheltered cove onshore to make camp. After a few days under the roasting Kimberley sun, and with little food or prospect of imminent rescue, the group fractured into two camps and quickly flared into conflict. One group set off with a party of Aboriginals sent from Kalumburu Mission and trekked over 150km to the Drysdale River Mission, while a small crew loyal to the captain stayed back to repair the ship. Diving underwater to plug the gaping cavity while crocodiles lurked nearby they restored it enough to limp 300km into Wyndham port. Within 24 hours the bombers returned and put in a few finishing blows from which the Koolama lurched on its side and settled into the mud at its present resting place.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Wyndham Tourist Information Centre"],["url="],["email=mail@thelastfrontier.com.au"],["address=Great Northern Hwy"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=At Kimberley Motors"],["phone=+61 8 9161 1281"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=On the odd occasion when they are open, they provide the usual maps and brochures on the area and free advice on how to get there."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From Kununurra"]},"\nWyndham is about 100km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kununurra"]]}," by road.
