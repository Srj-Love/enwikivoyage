It is renowned for the Residence, regarded as one of the finest palaces in Europe and a high point of Baroque art (also UNESCO cultural world heritage!). Würzburg is also home to one of the oldest churches in Germany, built in the 8th century on top of a former pagan shrine. One of its most famous structures, Festung Marienberg, is a fortress which now surrounds the church.\n\nWürzburg was the center of the kingdom known as Franconia. In the 19th century, Napoleon merged Franconia with Bavaria, by which the city is ruled to this day.\n\nWürzburg experienced heavy demolition during a 20-minute bombing raid in 1945 which destroyed some 80% of its city buildings. Much of the city has since been rebuilt, though not as painstakingly true to its original architecture as some other historic German communities. Anyone eager to visit this town to study its historic architectural structures should be prepared to see its restored buildings placed next to several post-war modernistic houses. Würzburg has been home to a large US military installment since post-World War II reconstruction. As a result, many of the locals are familiar with American customs.  However, as of 2006, the military base is scheduled to close which will cause the city to lose most of its American presence.\n\nToday Würzburg is a beautiful, historic, and lively city that is often overlooked by foreign visitors.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nWürzburg is not served by an airport.

Prices are naturally at the high end, but for fabulous food, great views, and an unforgettable ambiance - this is the place.\n\nGreat restaurants in the town centre include the Altemainmuehle, the Burgerspital, the Juliuspital and Stachel. All serve excellent food in rustic settings with by no means unreasonable prices.

Here you can expect a good honest meal at very reasonable prices in a friendly atmosphere. \n\nTakeaways include Tigris, Pinar as well as other Indian and Chinese establishments.
