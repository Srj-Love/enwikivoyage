If travelling locally, choose regional trains (called Regio) which are being operated by (now most frequently) quite new and modern Diesel carriages (called in Polish ",{"type":"''","value":["szynobus"]}," - literally ",{"type":"''","value":["bus on rail"]},"). Long distance trains could be very crowded in summer months.\nMain, small bus station is located next to train station in the city centre.

Some of the local buses has line numbers displayed on front screen and are run by ",{"type":"'''","value":["PKS Wejherowo"]}," (green and white buses).\n\nIt is a big challenge to fight with the increased road traffic during summer holidays while driving own car. When you wish to drive around, it is OK to ask your accomodation staff, which road is the best on your way (there are some opportunities to avoid the most crowded routes). \n\nYou may want to keep fit and to breathe a clean and salty air - then do not hesitate and rent a bike.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nIt is no problem to buy anything what you can need on holiday here. Lots of grocery shops can be found in the city centre. On the northeastern boundary of the city (on the road to Chałupy, Jastarnia and Hel) there is a Lidl supermarket. If you need some medicines, there is also no problem with finding a pharmacy store. You can also find lots of stands selling souvenirs and cheap crap made in China. It is good idea to buy a pack of sea shells or a jewellery made of amber. If you prefer traditional postcards than posting photos on Facebook, go and buy some postcards with funny inscriptions and pictures (even if you are more traditional, a postcard with a collage of sea or beach photos is a good idea).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Family Inn"]}," Pensjonat Anna Dettlaff‎, Brzozowa 21, 608-086-595‎"]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Pensjonat Wojciech"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.pensjonat-wojciech.pl"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Tel. 58 67 420 67, tel. 602 369 305; ul.
