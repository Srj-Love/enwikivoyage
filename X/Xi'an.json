For 1,000 years, the city was the capital for 13 dynasties, and a total of 73 emperors ruled here. Xi'an is the undisputed root of Chinese civilization having served as the capital city for the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties. With so much history within the ground the city lies upon, it is no wonder that there are so many historical ruins, museums and cultural relics to be found here. It was already influencing the world outside of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Wall of China"]]}," as the eastern terminus of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silk Road"]]}," （丝绸之路). Here traders from far and wide brought goods and ideas for sale and took goods and ideas back with them to their native countries. In present day Xi'an not much of its former glory remains within the city confines, due to the constant warfare and political changes that swept China particularly throughout the 20th Century. Today the city has a pleasant cosmopolitan flair to it and it is worth visiting for the famed Terracotta Warriors alone. It has often been said that, \"if you have not been to Xi'an, you have not been to China!\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nXi'an has most of its annual precipitation from August to late October in the form of rain.

As Xi'an is located in the heartland of China, it takes no more than 2 hours to fly to most major Chinese cities.\n\nMost people use taxis or the airport bus to reach town from the airport, however taking a taxi is not recommended, as most taxi drivers will raise the price for non-local tourists. A taxi will cost about ¥150 from the airport to the Bell Tower downtown. You will pay around ¥50-75 more if you take one of the climatized Japanese black taxis rather than the typical green taxis. At the airport, both types of taxis are waiting at the same spot to pick up passengers. The airport bus leaves the airport from 08:00 until 01:00, a ticket costs ¥26 and takes about one hour; there are several lines but the most useful are Airport Bus No. 1 (no stop to the terminus in front of the Melody Hotel, at the beginning of West Street near the Bell Tower) and No. 2 (to the railway station). As long as there is an arriving flight, there will be a bus, so don't worry about arriving late at night or early morning; officially, on line 1 there is a bus every 20 minutes but buses will often depart as soon as they fill up. The airport bus route is the best way between city and the train station. \n\nGetting to the terracotta warriors from the airport is complicated but can be done. Immediately when you walk out of the airport you can take bus #2 (¥27) to the train station. The train station is extremely crowded and most people do not speak English. When looking towards the train station, go to the parking lot on the right (in the east of train station square, Approx.100m away) and catch bus 306, also called Tourist Bus #5 (¥7).  There are many fake public buses, so make sure you only take #306! The last stop is the terracotta warriors.  To get back to the airport simply take the same exact route in reverse. Alternatively, taking taxi will costs you approx ¥85 plus toll charges of ¥15.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nXi'an has two major train stations: Xi'an Railway Station, located just north of the walled central city, for the \"conventional\" trains, and Xi'an North Railway Station, a few miles farther north, for high-speed service.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["\"Conventional\" trains"]},"\nThere are plenty of trains transporting passengers from Xi'an Railway Station to most of the major cities inside China. Keep in mind train tickets may only be available if booked far in advance (most ticket sales open 10–21 days in advance; an agent can help book but will probably charge significant commission fees). Traveling in a seat (hard or soft-class) means you will share the car space with lots of locals.  You will most likely encounter smokers, loud noise, and constant activity in the aisle while you try to sleep.  *Do not* travel hard class if you are uncomfortable with these settings.   Sleeper cabins are limited to 6 people each (4 for deluxe soft sleepers, which are only on a few trains from Beijing); bottom bunks cost a bit more because they're a couple cm wider and could be sit on.  If traveling alone, be especially careful of your luggage! Also note that bathrooms and washrooms may be closed (and locked!) 30–60 minutes before getting to the train station.\n\nTrains run to most major cities throughout China.

As you exit, there will probably be lots of people offering cheap hotel rooms; just ignore them if you already have a room booked. Even if you don't, you probably don't want to get one from them anyway. Also, don't fall for the people who offer to exchange a Xi'an map for your used train ticket - they reuse them for some shady purposes, e.g. re-selling them to people who just want to get into the station or try to sneak on a train.\n\nIt is very easy to get to the Xi'an Railway Station by city bus from anywhere in the city. There are several stops within 200 m of the station (look for train station East or North on a bus route (火车站东\/北).

Since there are many buses in the city, it can be useful to go to the Tourism Office Center (which is situated near the Drum Tower) and ask for a free map of the city, with the buses' lines on it.\n\nA popular line for tourists is #610 (also labeled \"游8\" in Chinese, which means \"tourist #8\") which connects the railway station, the Bell Tower, the Small Goose Pagoda and Xi'an Museum, the Shaanxi Historic Museum and the Big Goose Pagoda. Unfortunately it is not one of the most frequent (sometimes you can wait for half an hour, though usually it comes in a few minutes). Near the Bell Tower, it stops at the beginning of West Street; take it westwards to then go south to the museums and pagodas, take it eastwards to then go north to the railway station. Near the railway station (there are many stops for different lines) you can catch it at the third block on the main street going straight south from the station.\n\nAnother useful line is #609 that connects the Bell Tower, the South Gate and the Big Goose Pagoda. Near the Bell Tower, it stops at the beginning of South Street.\n\nAlthough the 609 and 610 can be infrequent, the 611 is very frequent (multiple departures every minute in the rush our), and connects the train station and the Bell Tower, continuing to the west from the latter. Look for its stop across the road from the station (within the city walls). Its route is a loop at the railway station, so you can board the bus at the same stop for the city centre where you got off for the railway station. At the Bell Tower its stop towards the railway station is located at the beginning of the East Street. \n\nThere are many buses leaving regularly for the Terracotta Warrior museum in front of the Xi'an bus station (east to the train station, outside (in the north) the city walls). \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Bus 306 (Chinese bus green 5) leaves from the lot in front of the train station and will take you to a parking lot right in front of the museum site in about an hour (it can take up to 90 minutes in case of traffic jams).

It can take a rather long time to find a vacant one and even then - given their choice of fares - they may decide to decline your destination for a more profitable one that is closer.  Watch the taxi drivers in Xi'an as the industry is not regulated as it is in other larger cities. You may find yourself being taken on a long ride around town to get where you are going. It can also be difficult to convince them to take you anywhere (even to the railway station). If in doubt get your hotel or hostel to write down the place you want to go in Chinese. Between 3 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon the taxis change their shifts. This means the drivers are rushing to their handover points, so they won't pick you up even if they are empty. \n\nTrips within the city walls are generally around ¥10, longer trips to the attractions south of the city are ¥12-20. Especially when you take a longer ride, like to or from the airport, it is always good advice to insist on using the taxi meter. \n\nThe rate for the normal (green) taxis is ¥6 for the first 2 kilometer and then ¥1.5 for every additional kilometer. Waiting times longer than 2 minutes will be charged ¥1.5 per minute. As of 2012, there is a fuel-surcharge on every ride of ¥1, so the price you have to pay is ¥1 higher than the meter shows (there is a sign on the taxi's dashboard showing this \"rule\"). After 23:00 the starting price is ¥7. At the airport and around some of the big hotels you might also find black taxis. They charge ¥2.4 per kilometer, but are more spacious and comfortable. There is a road fee of ¥10 for the Airport Expressway. This is not included in the price the taxi meter shows. So going to or coming from the airport is usually ¥10 more than what the meter shows.\n\nBe careful when taking a cab to areas outside Xi'an City, for example the bing ma yong. Such trips cost up to ¥120 and will not bring you all the way as the road is \"apparently under maintenance and only the local cabs know the rest of the road to bing ma yong\". So the cab will drop you off outside a building where you can view a model of bing ma yong for ¥30. Other local cab drivers will offer to bring you to a blue jade factory or a smaller version of bing ma yong after you view the replica. Be careful to reject going to such places as the cab drivers earn a commission from bringing you such places, which are no substitute for an authentic experience touring the actual bing ma yong. Thus, it is generally much safer and reliable to take the buses if you want to travel to bing ma yong.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\nFortunately Xi'an's main sites (with the notable exception of the Terracotta Warriors) are bunched fairly close together.

It's in Zhouzhi county (周至县 zhouzhi xian) and close to Tayu village (塔峪村 tayucun), approximately 1.5 km West of Louguantai Daoist temple (楼观台寺）. The coordinates are approximately 34 03'32.92\" N 108 18'26.19\" E.. It was built in 635 AD by Nestorian (Assyrian Church of the East) Christian missionaries who had come from Persia through Central Asia, Xinjiang and Gansu provinces via the silk road to Chang'an (modern day Xian, Shaanxi province) during the Tang dynasty. The site includes a replica of the Nestorian Steele, the original of which has been moved to the Xian Beilin Museum (The Forest of Steeles) and the site also includes a small exhibition room with information about the pagoda's Christian history and some information about Nestorian Christianity in China. The pagoda fell out of use as a Christian building after several centuries, as Nestorian Christianity lost adherents in China, and after some time was taken over by Buddhists. Today it is used by Buddhist monks as a monastery and a Buddhist shrine \/ temple. Half of the premises around the pagoda is used by the Buddhist monks and the other half is made up of historical monuments to Nestorian Christianity. Unless you make special arrangements before going there, you may only be able to see the bottom floor of the pagoda, which is now filled with an array of Buddhist statues. There are several floors in the pagoda which could only be reached with ladders or other climbing equipment. These floors contain paintings and sculptures depicting various Christian scenes. The exhibition room may also be locked unless you check beforehand.\n\nTo get there, go to Xian City Bus Station (西安汽车站）, also known as the Xi'an Long-distance bus station （市长途汽车站） or Shuisi bus station（水司汽车站） just outside the city wall on the southwest edge of city. It is close to the corner of Fengqing road (丰庆路） and the Western Ring road （城西路）. The entrance is in a smaller side street called Jiejiacun road (解家村路）,  which is about 300 metres west from the Fengqing lu \/ Western ring road intersection.\n\nAt this bus station take the bus which is going to Louguan （楼观）. Buses are quite frequent and the last buses for the day are around 17:30-18:00 to and from Louguan.\n\nSome buses take 1–2 hours and some take 2–3 hours. The quicker buses go down the expressways while the slower ones drive through the countryside through many small villages, stopping frequently to let passengers on and off before finally arriving at the carpark of Louguantai (楼观台）, which is a famous Daoist temple complex. You can confirm with the driver that you are going to the Louguantai carpark; if you can't speak Chinese, show him the Chinese characters. When you arrive at the carpark you should be at the corner of 108 Provincial road (S108 or 108 Sheng Dao) and 220 County road (220 Xian Dao). At this corner there will likely be some taxis waiting nearby some people selling snacks and refreshments. You should also see a small police station opposite this corner, next to a small supermarket. Ask one of the local taxi drivers to show you the way. You may have to negotiate a price without using the meter. The pagoda is approximately 2 km south west of this corner. The taxi driver should drive about 1 kilometre westwards on the S108, then turn left into tayucun road (塔峪村路). He should drive up the hill, and pass 2 or 3 bunches of small houses, before driving up a dirt (or mud) road before stopping. From here you will have to hike up the hill, which takes about 10 mins through some muddy footpaths past some corn fields and up onto the side of the hill where you will find the pagoda.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=Longhai Railway icon.png"],["imagesize1=100"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lanzhou"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xianyang"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zhengzhou"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanmenxia"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Xi'an"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Xi'an"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Shaanxi"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["34.26096"],["108.94233"],["zoom=13"]]}]
