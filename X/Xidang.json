As Feilaisi is getting more and more touristy, some people prefer staying in Xidang before starting the Yubeng trek.\n\nThere is an 80 yuan entrance fee to go to Yubeng but if you just stay in Xidang you can return the ticket and get your money back on the way out.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThere is a local bus from Deqin to Xidang daily at 3 pm and from Xidang back to Deqin at 8 am. The bus takes you to Xidang village, not up to the hot springs, unless there are enough people going up. It's 15 yuan from Deqin to Xidang, add 5-10 to go to the hot springs. Taking a minivan from Deqin is 150 yuan. It is also possible to hike down from Feilaisi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nWalk.

If the weather is cloudy, it is the only option to have a hot shower as the guesthouses use solar water heaters.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nHiking is pretty much the only option. You can hike to Mingyong (there is a path, don't walk the main road), Yubeng, a couple of viewing places (you can see Yubeng, holy waterfall and glacier lake from one spot)and Ninong.\nMaybe you can help the locals working on their fields.
