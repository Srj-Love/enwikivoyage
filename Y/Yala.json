It has an area of 4,521 square kilometres. It is the only landlocked province in the south. Yala is the border province with an interesting history, culture, and beautiful scenery. The province has a unique mixture of cultural heritage of several groups: Thai, Chinese, and Muslim. The city centre has systematic town planning and is one of the educational centres of the south as well.\n\nThe word \"Yala\" was derived from the local word \"yalo\" meaning \"fish net\". Yala used to be a part of Pattani, a colony of the Sukhothai Kingdom. In 1767 (2310 BE) when Ayutthaya fell to the Burmese, the southern colonies became independent. During the reign of King Rama I of the Rattanakosin Dynasty, the king sent his brother, Khrom Phra Ratchawangbowon Maha Surasihanat to take Pattani.  In 1808 (2351 BE), the king had Pattani partitioned into 7 smaller colonies, namely Mueang Pattani, Mueang Sai Buri, Mueang Nong Chik, Mueang Yaring, Mueang Ra Ngae, Mueang Raman, and Mueang Yala. Yala had changed its rulers many times before Monthon was abolished in 1933 (2476 BE) and finally became one of the provinces of Thailand.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car"]},"\n\nYala is 1,084 km south of Bangkok by road.
