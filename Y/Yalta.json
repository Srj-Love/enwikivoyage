Today mass tourism still sustains the city, which is understandable given its beautiful surroundings and proximity to many of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Crimea"]]},"'s major sights.\n\nSummer sees the city inundated with mainly Russian and Ukraininan tourists. However, consider a visit at any time of year: average temperatures are always above freezing (though it can and does occassionally freeze). Spring and autumn see some positively pleasant weather that can reach into high the 20 °Cs. Winters are not as cold as in the rest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ukraine"]]},". Protected from the North by the mountains and warmed by the Black Sea, there is never a lot of snow in the winter, but beware of the winds as they can be bitingly cold.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian"]]}," is the main language - getting by without a basic grasp will be difficult but not impossible. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ukrainian"]]}," is also spoken. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Crimean Tatar"]]},", which is very closely related to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkish"]]},", is spoken by the predominantly Muslim Tatar people: if you speak Turkish (and even if you don't!), you will be warmly welcomed by the Tatars. English is not widely spoken, but try your luck with younger people if you have to speak in English.\n\nPeople are generally friendly and crime in this city of over 80,000 people is low. Tourists are safe as long as they stay sensible: don't flash your cash, avoid unlit pathways at night (if only to avoid the drunks), and try to judge whether a strangers buying you drinks is being hospitable (most likely) or sinister (less likely, but possible).\n\nUkraine is not a rich country and many of the services etc are not up to Western standards. Be patient and bear that in mind and appreciate the good side of Yalta.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Simferopol"]]}," is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Crimea"]]},"'s main transport hub. From Simferopol the world's longest trolleybus route wends a scenic way to Yalta via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alushta"]]}," for around 3 hours (costs 15.25 hryvnias as of July 2013). The quality of the trolley buses varies. While the old Soviet ones may look retro-cool, consider waiting for one of the more modern, less characterful but more comfortable ones. Minibuses are faster but a bit more expensive (2 Euro). A taxi will typically cost 10 to 20 Euro and it will take just over an hour.\n\nBuses also run to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sevastopol"]]}," and other cities throughout Crimea and beyond.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nA decent network of cheap minibuses connects the centre of town and the outlying areas. Pay either when you board or when you get off: this can be slightly confusing at times! Taxis are everywhere; some are genuine, and some are just people offering you a ride for a fare. Speaking English means the fare goes up, but it is still very reasonable, so learn to haggle - if the price is too high walk away as there will always be someone else to barter with.\n\nYalta is a city that is spread out over a large area (Greater Yalta). The centre and harbor is a great place to walk around, but just beware of the local drivers as they tend not to give way for pedestrians. Traffic in the city in the summer months is heavy and you can be stuck in a jam if you go by a motor vehicle. Sometimes you may find it is much quicker to walk. The locals always dress up and walk around the harbor front at night - it's a great way to pass the evening away, or you can watch the people go by enjoying a drink at one of many cafes. The waterfront is well over a mile long - from McDonald's on the East end to the Hotel Oreanda on the West.  Walk the length to choose your beach, which will be somewhat \"rocky\".\n\nFerries connect the central ferry port (on Ulitsa Ruzvjelta) to nearby beaches and towns and the Swallow's Nest (famous folly perched on a cliff and now an Italian restaurant). Luxury cruise ships visit Yalta during the summer, on their way around the Black Sea, which is certainly a nice way to travel.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Useful bus numbers"]},"\nMinibuses to the palaces sometimes, but not always, have \"Дворец\" (meaning palace) mentioned on their route listings.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["11"]}," - runs from the main bus station and calls at stops on Ulitsa Kievskaya and at the top of Ulitsa Pushkinskaya before going on to end at the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Livadia Palace"]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["32"]}," - runs from the minibus stand in central Yalta to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Livadia Palace"]},", the Gaspra Sanatorium (next to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Swallow's Nest"]},"), Miskhor (next to the lowest station of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ai-Petri cablecar"]},"), and finally the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vorontsov Palace"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alupka"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Minibus ",{"type":"'''","value":["27"]}," and bus ",{"type":"'''","value":["102"]}," - run a similar route to the 32 but go from Yalta bus station, not the city centre."]},"In ",{"type":"'''","value":["Livadia"]},", the 27, 32 and 102 use a stop on the Sevastopolskoye Shosse main road, which is uphill from the palace; the number 11 ends up on a smaller road on the same level as the palace.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["5"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["100"]}," - run between ",{"type":"'''","value":["Livadia Palace"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Massandra Palace"]}," via central Yalta."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Trolleybus ",{"type":"'''","value":["2"]},", minibus ",{"type":"'''","value":["34"]}," and bus ",{"type":"'''","value":["29"]}," - run from the stop on Ulitsa Moscovskaya to Verkniy Massandrovskiy Park, from where it's a long walk uphill to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Massandra Palace"]}," - the 34 continues on to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nikita Botanical Gardens"]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Crimea South Coast 04-14 img13 Yalta Armenian Church.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["The Armenian church."]]},"\n\nMost of the sights are some way out of town and will require a bus, boat or taxi to reach.
