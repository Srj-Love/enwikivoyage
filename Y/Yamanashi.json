Just hours from Tokyo by bus, train, or car, Yamanashi is good for a day trip from the big city and allows travelers to experience the \"inaka\" (rural) Japan.  Yamanashi's major city, Kofu, lies at the center of this bowl-shaped prefecture, with some of Japan's most famous mountains rising along the horizon.  On a clear day, a visitor can see Mt. Fuji to the south,  Japan's second highest peak Kitadake and the majestic Minami Alps to the west, and the eight fractured peaks of Yatsugatake to the north.  Yamanashi offers a wealth of cultural experiences and outdoor excursions to those searching for the offbeat side of Japan.  Most foreign visitors overlook Yamanashi, but this small prefecture might be the ideal destination for a traveler tired of Tokyo's crowds.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nYamanashi is quite unusual amongst Japanese provinces in that its borders have remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years. Formerly known as Kai Province (甲斐国), the majority of the prefecture is formed of the Kofu Basin, a flat plain in the centre of the prefecture surrounded by virtually impassible natural moutain barriers. Kai was once the base of the famous samurai leader Takeda Shingen, a man who once looked certain to unite the whole of Japan until his mysterious death whilst on campaign. The people of Yamanashi celebrate him to this day.\n\nThough in terms of natural geography and history part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chubu"]]}," region of Japan, in modern times Yamanashi has much closer links to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]}," and the broader ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kanto"]]}," region. Its dialect is close to that of Tokyo albeit peppered with some unique local vocabulary.\n\nFor traveller Yamanashi might be seen to be composed of several regions which are not easily accessible by each other. \nOne is the Kofu basin, a large urban sprawl centred on Kofu city. \nThe other significant area is the south eastern Fuji Yoshida area, home to Mount Fuji.\nThere are also several other less prominent and more rural areas such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hokuto (Yamanashi)"],["Hokuto"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minobu"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kofu"]]}," - the prefectural capital"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Otsuki"]]}," - small city near Tokyo, with good hiking possibilities"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hokuto (Yamanashi)"],["Hokuto"]]}," - small city near Nagano"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThere are no airports in Yamanashi.

From Shizuoka you can connect to the Shinkansen which can be used to access Osaka and Nagoya, from Nagoya however the quicker option is to ride conventional express trains on the chuo line, switching between the Azusa and the Shinano at Shiojiri in Nagano. For both of these cities the bus is a quicker and cheaper alternative.\n\nThe super express trains of the Chuo line are the Kaiji (かいじ), Azusa(あずさ), and Super Azusa(スーパーあずさ). The fastest of these trains runs from Shinjuku to Kofu in just 1 hour 25 minutes. Compared to the highway bus, it is much faster, but also much more expensive. Local trains can also be used to get from Tokyo to Yamanashi with a change of train usually required from Tokyo's chuo rapid to the standard chuo line in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Takao"]]}," or occasionally ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Otsuki"]]},". This takes around 2 to 2 1\/2 hours and costs half the price of the express train.\n\nFrom special shops express tickets can be bought for 3,000 yen rather than the standard 3,500 yen (local tickets can also be bought for 200 yen savings). Several of these can be found in Tokyo including near Shinjuku station. In Kofu one can be found right in front of the station.\n\nThe super express of the Minobu line is called the Fujikawa(ふじかわ). Each day, it makes 7 round trip runs between Kofu Station(甲府駅) and Shizuoka Station(静岡駅) in approximately 2 hours.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nHighway bus services link Kofu to other cities, Shinjuku, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya. Four different companies make these runs. They are the Yamanashikotsu, Keio, Fujikyukou, and Kintetsu bus companies. Bus service may be cheaper, but the train is generally much faster and, other than of the route which goes to Shinjuku, are comparably fewer in number.\n\nLong-distance buses use terminals in Kofu Station (甲府駅) and Fujiyoshida Station (富士吉田駅). From Kofu Station you can take buses to Shinjuku, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, Narita Airport (成田空港 NRT), and Haneda Airport (羽田空港 HND). Fujiyoshida station (富士吉田駅) has bus services to and from Shinjuku, Tokyo, Kyoto Station (Hachijo), and Osaka.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Website of Yamanashi Kotsu bus services ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/yamanashikotsu.co.jp"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Alternative bus service website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.yamanashibus.com\/kousoku_osaka.htm "]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMany points in Yamanashi can be reached by the JR Chuo or JR Minobu train lines, with Kofu Station as a transportation hub for the prefecture.  The southeast part of the prefecture is accessible by the private Fuji Kyu line which connects to the Chuo line at Otsuki.  The Fuji Kyu line, Minobu line and Koumi line are all single tracked so services tend to be infrequent and somewhat slow. The chuo line is largely double tracked hence has two or three local trains and two or three expresses per hour each way. \n\nTo find train schedules for Yamanashi or anywhere in Japan, check Hyperdia",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hyperdia.com\/"]},", Kurage",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/kurage.kilo.jp\/"]}," or Jorudan",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jorudan.co.jp\/english\/norikae\/e-norikeyin.html"]},"  for train schedules in English.\n\nMost cities throughout the prefecture have local bus lines in addition to trains.\n\nPublic transportation in Yamanashi isn't the best and even the central Kofu Urban Area itself is designed around the idea that most people have cars.
