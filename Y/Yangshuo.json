[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Yongshuebanner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Yangshuo"]}," (阳朔; ",{"type":"''","value":["Yáng shuò"]},") is a very scenic, small county and city surrounded by many karst mountains and beautiful scenery near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guilin"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangxi"]]},". It is very popular among tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nYangshuo is popular for its incredible karst scenery, beautiful mountains, rivers, caves, and temples as well as its laid back cafes and bars. However, as a result, there is no shortage of mainland Chinese tourists, expats and other foreigners.\n\nYangshuo is not a typical Chinese town and does not have the big-city feel of other Chinese cities. That means it is relatively air and noise pollution free, (provided you get away from major roadways), is very clean (by Chinese standards) and does not usually suffer from endless massive traffic chaos. It is much more like a vacation town, with wonderful restaurants and shops and again quite developed by mainland Chinese standards.\n\nYangshuo has a reputation as a foreigners' village in Southern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]}," and is a major stop on the trail of many independent travellers. It is also a nice place to stop and explore the local countryside by bike or even try your hand on the world class rock-climbing sites.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Yangshuo.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["350px"],["Looking up West Street from near the river"]]},"\nYangshuo town is laid out roughly like a ladder. The two main tourist streets run more-or-less parallel up from the river and end at one of the town's larger streets. There are assorted smaller streets (rungs) crossing between the two larger streets. The street (ladder vertical) on the left seen from the River is ",{"type":"'''","value":["West Street"]}," (西街 ",{"type":"''","value":["Xijie"]},") and is the older more established tourist street, the real centre of things. The other long tourist street is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Diecuilu"]}," (畳翠路).\n\nThere is a small creek that runs down the ",{"type":"''","value":["centre of the ladder"]},"; some of the prettiest bars and restaurants in town are on balconies near it. The street there is called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Guiha Lu"]},". It has recently undergone heavy rebuilding and now has many new shops, bars and restaurants. Toward the river end, it curves to intersect Diecielu.\n\nAt the ",{"type":"''","value":["foot of the ladder"]}," by the river is an open area with a large number of vendors hawking all sorts of tourist stuff, both from shops and from handcarts. There are also a number of rather nice riverside hotels.\n\nAcross the ",{"type":"''","value":["top of the ladder"]}," is a major street (Pantao Rd) with many hotels. The town's main bus station is at the corner where that main street meets Die Cui Lu. The intersection has a large open area that becomes very busy at night, with dozens of restaurants and hundreds of diners. Do not expect English menus or non-Chinese dishes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nYangshuo has no airport. The nearest airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Guilin Liangjiang International Airport"]}," (airport code KWL) in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guilin"]]},", served by many Asian carriers with several daily flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]},". It is generally cheaper to fly to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guilin"]]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]}," than from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]},", just across the border as flights from Shenzhen are considered a domestic flight, whereas from Hong Kong is international. There is also a daily flight from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur"]]}," by Air Asia.\n\nAn easy but comparatively costly way to get to Yangshuo is by taxi. It is far better to have your pick-up arranged by your hotel as local drivers in Guilin will overcharge you and drivers generally do not know anything else in Yangshuo than the bus station where they will drop you off and you need to arrange transportation from there onwards. Expect to pay between ¥260-400 depending on the vehicle, and depending on whether you take the G65 Baomao highway (additional ¥30 for toll fees but saves about half an hour). Be advised that taking the highway is much faster, less bumpy and better for your blood pressure as you will not have to watch as your driver plays chicken with oncoming traffic while passing all the transport trucks moving at 40 km\/h on the regular road.\n\nTo get to Yangshuo by bus, first take the airport bus (¥20), which makes three stops.  Other airport shuttles cost ¥20 and operate without a fixed schedule. A shuttle bus (¥20) leaves for the airport every 30 minutes from the CAAC (Civil Aviation Administration of China) building on Shanghai Road, Xiangshan District. Be aware that like most bus services in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},", the bus will not leave the airport until full, so you may be faced with a wait. Get off at the second stop near the train station for buses to Yangshuo. You can also get off at the last stop in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guilin"]]}," and then take a bus or boat to Yangshuo.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe nearest railway station is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guilin"]]},". A direct overnight train from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]}," (on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," border) operates to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guilin"]]}," (12 hours). Some hotels will arrange pick up from the train station. Minibuses to Yangshuo conveniently depart from the square in front of Guilin railway station (¥18, 80–90 minutes). These buses are untrustworthy, known to scam many tourists and take a long time to make the journey as they constantly stop to gather more passengers. The safest and more ideal method of getting to Yangshuo is to ignore the bus touts and turn North (left from the station) and walk the 300m to the main bus terminal. Here buses are properly ticketed, safe and direct(¥15, 50–60 minutes).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guilin"]]},", there are frequent minibuses and express buses to Yangshuo. All buses terminate at the bus terminal in Yangshuo. There are two services, private and government run.  Private buses depart from the square in front of the Guilin railway station (80–90 minutes, ¥18, buy tickets on the bus once it is underway. Invariably touts will try to sell you a more expensive ticket before the bus departs, even coming onto the bus. The best approach is simply to ignore them. The government run service are express buses that depart every twenty minutes from the Guilin Bus Terminal off Zhongshan Zhong Lu and take about one and a half hour (¥22, buy tickets from counter inside terminal).\n\nIn Yangshuo, wait for private buses at the exit of the bus terminal at PanTau Lu. The first bus to depart will be at the head of the queue. Government run express buses depart every twenty minutes starting at 07:00 from their allotted bay inside the terminal. Buy tickets from the glass counter.\n\nOn the bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guilin"]]},", unscrupulous hawkers frequently stop the bus before the center of town (near the service station) urging you to get off while claiming this is Yangshuo and the bus will continue to another place. The bus conductor will often be complicit in the scam and even tell you that you've arrived at the bus station. The tout's goal is to get you to pay them to take you to the centre of town and to their hotel. Note: Buses from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangdong"]]}," really don't go to the bus station; they just let you off in town, a ten-minute walk from the main tourist area following the signs to West Street.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangdong"]]},", overnight sleeper buses run direct to Yangshuo from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]}," (near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]},"), from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zhuhai"]]}," (near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Macau"]]},"), and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangzhou"]]},". These cost around ¥100-250 depending on which station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]}," you want to depart from and how new of a bus you want to travel on. Some sleeping buses from Shenzhen are quite uncomfortable.  The buses from the border in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]}," are the most expensive.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nanning"]]},", there are 3 buses per day. The journey costs ¥120 and buses leave at 08:00, 10:00 and 12:30. Tickets can be bought inside the bus terminal.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:漓江山水.jpg"],["thumb"],["Li River"]]},"\nThere are also boats that travel down the Li River from Guilin, slower and more expensive (¥400+) than buses, but a very scenic journey. You may be able to travel for about ¥100 by joining a tour group. You will pass some of China's most famous scenic views, including a mountain view that can be seen on all ¥20 bills. Do check with your travel agent or hotel which boat you will be on as standards can vary a lot. Ask for a picture to be sure it is what you had in mind. Do not go with the CITS travel agents that approach you just when you get off the train and will either overcharge or sell you devalued trips in their office inside the train station.\n\nIn the winter time, which is the dry season, the boats often only travel starting halfway down the Li River from Guilin. A tour company should inform you of this. It is still worth taking the journey. You will then travel part of the way by bus or private taxi, then join the boat where the water is deep enough (this may vary).\n\nIn case you do not come on a Li River cruise, numerous boat trips on motorized rafts can be booked anywhere in Yangshuo. It is also very nice to hike the most scenic part between Yangdi and Xing Ping.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\nRenting a bike and taking off into the countryside, with or without a guide, is one popular strategy for exploring the area. There are several places around the main street catering for short-term rentals charging ¥10-30.\n\nMost times you get what you paid for. Be sure to check brakes and gears before you set off so not to get your day spoiled by mechanical problems that could be avoided. Generally the SPX, Giant's and Hunter's are the brands to go for. Expect to pay ¥50 for a TREK-bicycle, the best ones to be found here. If you want to play it safe, some places will get you a helmet for extra.\n\nBeware of robbers who operate on a motorbike and will try to snatch your camera, rucksack or handbag from the basket behind if you leave it open. Try to one that closes and lock it with your bike lock.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By motorbike"]},"\nAt least two guesthouses offer motorbike rent:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dragon-river-retreat.com\/Facilities.asp Dragon River Retreat"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hostelz.com\/hostel\/+201237-En-Attendant-Godot-Youth-Hostel En Attendant Godot Youth Hostel"]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis in Yangshuo are very few compared to other bigger cities, because they are limited by the government. They are more expensive than elsewhere in China, and they will all refuse to use the meter if they have any; thus you have to bargain and agree to a price before getting on. Taxi drivers will ask you ¥25-30 for a ride within the town (from 100m to 3 km), but, after bargaining, you can easily achieve a price of ¥10 for the aforementioned distance.\n\nThere are numerous open air three wheel style taxis and motorbike taxis. Agree to a price before getting on and bargain hard. If you are staying outside of the main town, try to arrange transport in advance if you want to avoid haggling or being ripped off. Some hotels offer free or low-price shuttle services, and it is often a good ideal to take advantage of these services. For a trip about 5 km outside of town the various taxis (normal, three wheel, motorbike) will ask at least ¥35, but the final price can be lower after bargaining.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By motorbike taxi"]},"\nOn many street corners there are men waiting on their motorbike. They will take you anywhere in town for a flat fee of ¥5.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\nYangshuo is a small place, the town can easily be covered on foot. There is an electric minibus network consisting five routes covering most parts of town. ¥1 per ride.\n\nIf you are planning on walking around the many streets and caves around Yangshuo, a map is recommended. Artistic tourist maps are available for sale for around ¥5-10 at tourist shops all over town, but the free maps are better for finding your way.\n\nFor those who want to wander a little further afield, or to check the attractions in the area, there are several options.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nThere are boat tours up or down the river.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nLocal buses serve some locations. From Yangshuo's bus terminal, minibuses (",{"type":"''","value":["xiao mian bao"]},", litt. little bread loaves) go to Gaotian (for Yueliang Shan\/Moon Hill), Jinbao via Baisha (for Yulong Qiao\/Dragon Bridge), Shazhi (for Fuli village), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xingping"]]}," (for the Xingping-Yangdi scenic area) and further afield.\n\nClimbers should look for the Gaotian minivan at the end of the row which leaves every 15 minutes - tell driver 'Banyan Tree' or 'Moon Hill' and they will stop for you.  Get on bigger blue bus to Puyi (two busses down from Gaotian van) which leaves every half-hour for The Egg and White Mountain. The driver will know where to stop, don't sweat it.  These rides are ¥3 each way, pay when getting off or when the girl comes around, and please have small bills or exact change.  After climbing just go back to where you got dropped off and you'll be picked up shortly. Last returning bus picks up Egg climbers at 18:30.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nIt is possible to hire private cars for others.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tour guides"]},"\nMost hostels or hotels can arrange transportation and a guide if you want one. A guide may be very helpful for things like cycling tours. Guides can also be found at 'Expat Services' on Chenzhong Rd, next to 7th Heaven. At the entrance of west street,guides will be found there too.\n\nAlternately, you can choose your own tourist guide by working out a deal with one of the many who will accost you on the street. Some local guides are simply savvy street wise individuals trying to make some money, whilst others are registered and take government examinations. Expect to pay around 100Y a person per day. Whilst some of the unlicensed guides can be very good at what they do, be careful that you are not simply being taken on a 'shopping' tour where you feel pressured into spending money you do not wish to.\n\nIf you want to go and see a larger region or even start a tour to the rest of the province or the neighboring provinces, you can get in touch with one of the local foreigner-run travel services. They can give you good advice or organize an authentic-orientated private tour for you with your own car\/driver and experienced tour guide.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Moonrock.jpg"],["thumb"],["Moon hill, Yangshuo, China"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:MoonHill2.JPG"],["thumb"],["Image taken from the top of the hike to moon hill in Yangshuo, China"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Karst landscape"]},"\nThe area around Yangshuo is renowned throughout China, if not the whole world, (even making it into the backdrop of Star Wars Episode 3), for its karst landscape where there are hundreds upon hundreds of limestone hills dotting the countryside.

It is not an incredibly long trek to the top but the gradient and strange angle of the steps can do something strange to your legs on the way down. The Moon Hill Cafe at the base of the hill sells fairly mediocre food at ridiculously high prices, and you may need something after the trek up and down.

It's open from 08:00-21:00.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nBeing the first backpackers' destination in China in the 1980s, Yangshuo is a well developed touristy place which, sadly, comes along with many annoyances that are not common in other places in China. Some travelers call Yangshuo the worst place in China for overcharging, persistent touts and tour pimps, and illegal occupancy of a route to extort money from tourists.\n\nOn the West street, besides annoying pimps and taxi drivers, prices for clothing and souvenirs could be skyrocketing to up to 100-500%. Unlike other Chinese places that groceries items are usually sold at standard prices, Yangshuo has a two price system - one for local Chinese, another for non-local Chinese and Westerners.\n\nFrom Yangshuo to Yulonghe, a popular route for biking, you may pass through a Longtan Village (龙潭村) where villagers are known to set up an illegal checkpoint to request ¥20 for any entrance. Rock climbers have also experienced similar practices on some hills.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pickpockets"]]}," in the town are rare now, particularly as Yangshuo has installed security cameras in tourist areas.  Be vigilant on buses, when travelling from or to Guilin, the government run non-stop bus service is safer than the private operations.  Reports of bag snatching by motorbike are frequently heard, the most common form are thieves using motorbikes to snatch bags in rear baskets of bicycling tourists; keep your bags locked to the bike and if a cage cover is provided with the basket, close and lock it, or better yet, carry belongings in front of you.  Thieves will take opportunities presented to them, so keep all your valuables in sight at all times.\n\nTheft reports are frequently made from swimmers. Despite numerous reports of theft, particularly at the Secret Beach (Shuan Tan), petty theft continues to thrive almost to a daily occurrence, and police seem disinterested in targeting the criminals. Thieves will go for bags and valuables, but have also been known to take even petty objects of seemingly no value.  Do yourself a favor and bring only the necessities for swimming.\n\nTouts of bamboo rafts for Yangdi to Xingping, a route best known for its landscape printed on the background of a ¥20 banknote, are notorious for a system to \"claim\" the ownership of a tourist. Once you talk to the touts on the bus, no one else can discuss the price with you except the touts from their own team. If you want to hassle by yourself instead of reserving a bamboo raft from a travel agency, DO NOT talk to any touts on the bus.\n\nAt nights, Yangshuo is safe but after 01:00, the streets are dark and you better carry your torch. In some bars popular with western tourists, boozers can also be disturbing and aggressive. Noise pollution is a major problem in hotels and on streets as in most of China. Pick your location wisely or bring ear plugs if holed up in the entertainment district.\n\nTraffic regulations, if any, are also practiced half-heartedly. Pedestrians should not expect a driver to stop at a green cross-walk sign and motorbikes can come in any directions even on a pedestrian's road. If in doubt, follow the lead of a local when crossing the street. However, Chinese traffic rules tend to protect the rights of pedestrians when accidents happen. When you get hit, a driver will have to cover all your medical expenses and any loss. The negotiation on compensation is often done in a police station.\n\nThanks to seriously enforced regulations on hotels and hostels, accommodation-related tourist traps practically do not exist but be aware of the sudden surge in prices during the Chinese National Day on 1st Oct and the Chinese New Year in Jan or Feb.\n\nLastly, Yangshuo Police has taken a proactive step towards being more approachable by tourists.  A few designated police deal almost exclusively with foreigners and their English is extremely good.  Yangshuo Police have tracked thieves down, caught culprits and managed to return stolen valuables.  There is a small police box at the top of West Street or a larger police station on FuQian Xiang.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Nearby"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Huangyao Ancient Town"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Huangyao Ancient Town is just over an hour outside of Yangshuo by coach.
