The area is friendly and safe with a lot of historical sites to visit. There is little congestion on the streets and is very quiet. It is known for a good school district and a reputation for welcoming visitors to the community.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nYardley was founded by William Yardley, who immigrated to America in July, 1682 with his family. He made an agreement with William Penn, before leaving England, to buy 500 acres for ten pounds. A survey was completed in October 1682, and the area William Yardley settled was called \"Prospect Farm.\" It was located just outside of the present Yardley Borough. William Yardley died in 1693, and his family in 1702-1703, possibly of smallpox.\n\nA nephew, Thomas Yardley, came to America in 1704 to settle the estate and never returned to England. He opened a ferry line which started operating in 1710 from Letchworth Avenue, the lower boundary of the village, and landed in New Jersey further downstream. This was an important link between West Jersey and the three roads leading to Philadelphia by way of Falls, Langhorne and Newtown. The Yardley family occupied the land for more than 150 years.\n\nWhen Yardley was founded there were already small settlements at nearby Burlington, Bristol, and Falls Ferry.\n\nYardley began to develop into a village about 1807, and by 1880 had a population of 820. Early industries included a spoke and handle factory, sawmill, felloe factory, plate and plaster mill, and two flour mills. The first post office, established in 1828, used the name \"Yardleyville.\" The name became \"Yardley\" again at the time the Reading Railroad came through the area in 1876.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Yardley was a station for the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Underground Railroad"]]},", an escape route for slaves. Known hiding places were under the eaves of the Continental Hotel (now the Continental Tavern), in bins of warehouses on the Delaware Canal (completed in 1862), and at the General Store (now Worthington Insurance). At Lakeside, the yellow house facing Lake Afton on N. Main St., one brick-walled cellar room is also thought to have been a hiding place.\n\nYardley Borough was incorporated on March 4, 1895.\n\nThe Train Collectors Association, which now boasts worldwide membership of 30,000 individuals, was founded in Yardley in 1954.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe two main ways to get into Yardley are by train (SEPTA) and car.\nIn order to get into the quiet town, one must take the R3 West Trenton Regional Rail through SEPTA.\nBy car, one is able to travel southbound on I-95 from Trenton, NJ and northbound on I-95 from Philadelphia.\n\nCar is the chosen mode of transportation in Yardley, however due to its relatively small size, walking is also an option in certain parts of the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Pennsbury Manor"],["url=http:\/\/www.pennsburymanor.org\/"],["email="],["address=400 Memorial Road in nearby Morrisville"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The country home of William Penn that has a view of the Delaware river.
