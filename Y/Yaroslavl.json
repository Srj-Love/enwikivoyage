The buses are the same price, although much less frequent. Marshrutki are a different proposition altogether, and although costing a shade more at 15r per journey, are incredibly efficient. You can tell the driver where and when to stop, by shouting out \"Ostanaveetye pazhalusta\", or, if you want to get off at the next stop, \"na ostanovkye\". Sometimes, at the back of the marshrutki, there is a button above the rear doors, which will ask the driver to stop at the next available place.\n\nTransport is incredibly busy between 8 and 9 in the morning and between 4 and 6 in the evening. You may find you have to push to get on and off. A useful phrase here is \"Vykhoditye na sledooyushi?\", which means \"Are you getting off at the next stop?\". Regardless of the answer, it will indicate your intention to get off.\n\nThat said, the centre of Yaroslavl is a very small place, and you will probably need only one trolleybus: the number 1, which starts at the train station, and goes all the way down Svobody, through Volkovo to Yaroslavl's own Red Square.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tolga monastery 776.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Tolga monastery"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["The historical center of the city"]}," is located at the river confluence which is also a UNESCO World Heritage site.
