This small city is located in a good spot to explore the surrounding sites for a few days, and in a fantastic area for hiking and spelunking.  The city itself is right by the main North-South highway and has comfortable accommodations and is a very typical town in Armenia for those who want an experience outside of Yerevan.  Things to see in the area include the Areni wine country, the spectacular canyon and monastery in Noravank, the impressive Smbatabert Fortress\/Tsakhats Kar Monastery area, the old silk road caravanserai of Selim, sitting on top of the world, lot of other monuments and a number of caves and cavern systems.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nVans (Marshutni) to Yeghegnadzor are the cheapest way to get in from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yerevan"]]},".

Armenians outside of Yerevan are very friendly.  If you try to hitch stand on the side of the road a little outside of town on the highway leading to Yeghegnadzor and hold out your hand.  Do not be surprised if they driver who picks you up invites you to his home for horovats (Armenian BBQ).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Smbataberd-raffi kojian-DCP 1545.JPG‎"],["thumb"],["Smbataberd"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Spitakavor-raffi kojian-DCP 3983.JPG"],["thumb"],["Spitakavor Monastery"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Tsakhats kar-raffi kojian-DCP 1532.JPG‎"],["thumb"],["Tsakhats Kar"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Areni Wine Country"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Just a couple of villages from Yeghegnadzor is Areni, famous for its wine from grapes of the same name.
