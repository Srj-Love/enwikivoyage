[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Yelagiri"]}," (also spelt ",{"type":"'''","value":["Elagiri"]}," on some signboards) is a town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tamil Nadu"]]},", a state in the south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},".\n\nYelagiri, at a height of 920 meters above sea level, stands majestically amidst four mountains. This is a hill station with a salubrious climate prevailing throughout the year so that winters do not keep visitors away. The main inhabitants of the area are the tribals who live in the 14 small villages which comprise Yelagiri. These tribals are engaged in agriculture, horticulture, forestry, etc. - all the occupations of rural hill folk. Their customs and habits, and especially the structure of their houses is unique and attracts a number of tourists to this hill station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangalore"]]}]},"\nYelagiri is about 150 km from Bangalore and 250 km from Chennai (Madras), good for a four hour bike ride with breaks along the way. Take the NH7 out of Bangalore towards Hosur, turn towards Chennai (onto NH46) at Krishnagiri and continue until you get just before Vaniyambadi. You can see the Hills from quite a distance (on your right). From a break in the highway that comes approx 2 km after the toll gate, turn right into the underpass road that takes you to Tirupathur. Continue some 5 km and at Ponneri Junction take a left to Yelagiri Hills. The routes are all marked with signboards in English.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chennai"]]}]},"\nYelagiri is about 258 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chennai-Tambaram"]]},". Take the Poonamalee High Road out of the city to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ponamalee"]]}," Town. From Poonamalee, take the Bangalore highway towards Vellore. The distance to Vellore is about 140 km and the route passes through Sriperumbudur, Walajapet. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vellore"]]}," would be a good place to plan a break, there are a lot of eating places right on the highway. From Vellore continue on to Ambur and then towards Vaniyambadi. On the highway about 45 km from the third(counting from Chennai) toll station, watch out for a signboard for \"Elagiri - 22 kms\". Take a left at this exit. Its easy to miss this left and if you overshoot this you would reach the Vaniyambadi toll station in about 1km. Continue on this road (SH18) till you reach Ponneri junction which has Thirupathur straight and Yelagiri on the left. Watch out for this one as it is easy to miss. (On the left, you'll see a big sign board 'Tamilnadu Tourism Department Welcomes You'. Turn left at this junction, there's a sign board pointing towards Yelagiri.)\n\nThe roads are well punctuated with signboards in English, and the roads especially the Chennai-Vaniyambadi stretch are excellent (in 2007). It is fairly safe, watch out for the occasional truck that changes lanes abruptly.  The last petrol pump is after you turn left at Ponneri, a little before you start on the ghat section. There are no petrol pumps on the hills.\n\nThere are 14 hairpin bends on the ghat road from Ponneri to Yelagiri and the road is pretty narrow so you can't actually park a car to enjoy the view except at some of the wider hairpin bends. Bikes won't have this problem though.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nIf you are coming by train from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangalore"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chennai"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coimbatore"]]}," you have to get down at Jolarpettai Junction.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Public transport"]},"\nIf you prefer to take public transport, buses come from Thirupattur and Jolarpet. You can take a taxi also from these places. You can negotiate for about 1200 INR (2011) to drop you in Yelagiri Hills from Jolarpettai Junction.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Things to remember"]},"\n\nPlease note there are no petrol stations in Yelagiri, thus you have to fillup the tank at the last available petrol station in the plains (however, try to avoid HP petrol bunk in Poneri because they don't give pure petrol). Except for a few tire changers there are no vehicle repair shops in the hills.\n\nAlso, please take your first-aid kit along with your regular medicines, if any, with you. There is a government primary health centre, and a private clinic (in which the doctor is from CMC vellore). The nearest health centre is in Tirupattur.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAs for getting around you may have to make your own arrangements for commuting in the hills. There are auto-rickshaws and a few taxis for hire, but it is a great place for trekkers. \n\nEach village has a Murugar Temple, small and big. At Nilavoor there is a devi temple for Kadavu-Nachiyar, which opens for puja only on Fridays between 11AM and 12PM in the morning. The villagers around believe this Goddess is very powerful and throng the place in good numbers on fridays.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere are 14 hair pin bends named with Tamil Poets(Pari Valivu, Ori Valivu, Kamban Valivu etc...) those leads to Yellagiri Hills. There is a sort of an observatory, after 12th bend with a telescope pointing towards the plains. It is difficult to park a car here owing to the narrow roads. Bikes should be fine.\n\nOn the way to the hills, you can see lots of small animals like monkeys, ox, goats, etc.  Do not feed these animals as they can be dangerous. Don't forget to carry binoculars with you.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Don Bosco Centre"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/guezou.org"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Yellagiri Hills.

Its an easy climb of about an hour with infrequent breaks (about a 1000 foot climb). Smaller peaks like Javadu Hills, Palamathi Hills and others are an easier climb. Start early though and be back before 9AM, for once the sun climbs up it can get rather uncomfortable."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Jalagamparai Waterfalls"]}," - Jalagamparai waterfalls are a 5 km trek from Yelagiri downhill. Its a tough trek, but the view from the sides of the mountain, of the valley, is truly rewarding. April probably is not a good time to visit the falls, as there is no water this time of the year. Recently (May 2007) there was no water in the falls. A tea shop owner said that there has been no water in this falls for the past 5 years. The tourist taxi operator may give you false information that recently there were some rain in this area and there may be water in the falls. His objective is to get money for the number of kilometers he runs the vehicle and not tourists' interest and pleasure. Just check this with somebody before you make a trip to this place. Otherwise it is a wasted trip. Especially if you go in the hot sun between 10AM to 12:30AM you will get headache. At the same time if one is interested in seeing the villages and the green pastures it may be fine. Next to the falls there is a temple at the top."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Uphill"]}," for 4km can be fun when in groups. Donâ€™t forget to carry water, you will not find a drop of water to drink once you reach the hilltop.  You can see the clouds touching the lush green hills in early morning- an amazing sight. Make sure you wear sneakers as the trek can be a treacherous climb. You can hire locals from the village to help you as guide on your trek for around Rs 300. It takes 2-3 hrs to climb the top of the hill, depending on your speed and agility. It is suggested to take frequent pit stops and enjoy the greenery. You can follow a radio tower beyond the Samaritan School on the hill top as you ascend- you can also follow the pathway laid by locals to guide your way up. Once you reach the top, you will see a small temple near the radio tower. Legend claims that the god in the temple saves people from being attacked by bears and evil spirits.  You can climb a huge rock near the tower with the help of an iron ladder to take a breathtaking view of the valley beneath, nestled between the lush green forest and mountains- a true nature lover's paradise.
