It is 20 miles long by 5 miles wide.  The landscape is largely made up of moorland and peat bog, giving some credence to the fact that its name derives from the Old Norse for 'barren'.

Ferries leave from Toft, 25 miles north of Lerwick.  Boards on the A970 just out of Lerwick give information on whether the ferries are running (which in the case of extreme weather they may not be).  Follow the signs to 'The North Isles'(Toft).  The ferry terminals on this route are extremely basic, no more than a small waiting room with toilets and a timetable.  Allocation of space on the ferry for cars is by lane, with one being for pre-booked traffic which takes priority over other vehicles.  In spite of the instructions on the timetable it is seldom necessary to book except at peak periods. The ferry to Yell (Ulsta) takes around 20 minutes and you are able to leave your vehicle and go up to the observation deck where there are refreshment machines and a good view over the sound (with the possibility of whale spotting).
