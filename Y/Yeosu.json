[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Yeosu"]}," (여수,麗水, pronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["Yersu"]},") is a coastal city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Jeolla"]]}," province, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Korea"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Port of Yeosu.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Port of Yeosu"]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nYeosu is one of the country's most picturesque port cities especially at night. Famous for its seafood, beaches, flowers and marinas, it is developing as an international ocean resort and tourist destination as well as being selected as a host city for the 2012 World Expo in Yeosu Harbor. \n\nThe city of Yeosu consists of the Yeosu peninsula as well as 317 islands (49 inhabited, 268 uninhabited) with population of 300,000. Yeosu is a city of history and loyalty where the headquarters of South Jeolla Province Navy Base was located, and the Great Admiral Yi Sun Shin invented the Geobukseon or \"a turtle ship\" to save the country while serving as the Navy Commander when Japan invaded Korea in 16th century.\n\nLying about midway along the southern coast of South Korea, Yeosu has cool summers and mild winters  thanks to the sea wind and warm current. Its blessed ocean climate also brings Yeosu relatively longer springs and autumns than other regions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\nYeosu is fairly spread out with a ton of districts each segregated by mountains or ocean. The main CBD centerd around Jungang-dong and the harbor overlooking Dolsan Bridge is quite compact, however.\n\nWest of the harbor and through a mountain tunnel is Yeoseo-dong, a roughly circular neighborhood nestled in between mountains with a small downtown district in the center. A great deal further west lies Ssangbong-dong, home to Yeosu City Hall, a second smaller port and a bunch of fancy tourist hotels.\n\nSouth of the harbor and across Dolsan Bridge are the many islands and islets that make up the Yeosu chain. Most of the larger ones are connected in a rough circle by a road well covered by public transportation. The vast majority of tourist attractions lie on this ring road.\n\nEast of the harbor and tucked on another little stretch of coastline is the site for the Yeosu 2012 World Expo, at present a huge construction site. Yeosu's Korail train station is located here.\n\nTo finish off the compass points, to the north is the land access to Yeosu, and all the industrial areas (lit up nicely at night).\n\nFinally, there is an additional urban corridor tucked between the harbour, Yeoseodong and the northern region. This thin stretch contains mostly residential housing, but also an E-mart and Yeosu's Intercity Bus Terminal.\n\nYeosu is developing like most of Korea, but retains a small-town charm that is vanishing from the country.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.koreanair.com\/ Korean Air"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/flyasiana.com\/gateway\/gateway_en.html Asiana Air"]},"fly between ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/yeosu.airport.co.kr\/doc\/yeosu_eng\/ Yeosu Airport"]}]},"(여수공항, 麗水空港, ",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["RSU"]]},") and Gimpo Airport (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seoul"]]},") up to 8 times a day and it takes one hour. Korean Air also has flight between Yeosu and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jeju"]]}," on Friday and Sunday. The airport has information desk, convenience store, restaurant, snack bar and rent car office. There are buses to various parts of the city but taxi is cheap and more convenient.

A trip from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seoul"]]}," to Yeosu takes about 3 hours 20 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe best way around the CBD is by taxi as the city is fairly small and taxi fare is quite cheap.

Each bus stop should have a posting of the buses that will arrive and their respective stops but most have been inexplicably vandalised. Those that do still exist are strictly in Korean.\n\nOnce south of the main bridge, most buses actually take a similar route so it can be easy to hop on and off in whichever direction to wish to head. The one exception to this is a branch where half the buses turn south-east to stop at the hermitage whereas the rest continue south around the island chain.\n\nThe \"magic number\" bus, if you can call it that, is the 111. This bus travels a zig-zagging route from the Intercity bus Terminal to Hyangiram Hermitage via Jinnamgwan and the harbour, crossing the Dolsan Bridge and passing many of the tourism attractions on the southern islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Hyangiram Hermitage"],["alt=향일암"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A beautiful temple-like hermitage with views of the sea and the scattered islands that make up Yeosu Peninsula.
