The Keisei Main Line train, with one across-the-platform transfer at Aoto, will cost ¥1450 to Yokohama. The Sky Access line train will cost ¥1630. Most Sky Access trains run to Keisei Ueno, but there are a handful each day which run through to Yokohama (and beyond; generally to Kanazawa-Bunko) on the Keikyu Main Line.\n\nFrom Haneda Airport, take the Keikyu Line's Airport Express (エアポート急行) to Yokohama station in 30-35 minutes for ¥470. Note that the Airport Express has several variants: If the train's destination is Shin-Zushi (新逗子) or Kanazawa-Bunko (金沢文庫), then you can stay on the train for the entire trip.

The line’s stations itself are worth seeing, especially Minato-Mirai Station itself, where you are able to see straight up to the very spacious entrance hall (7 floors in all) of the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the tallest building in Japan. \n\nBashamichi Station is with artifact bricks and hosts the remains of the first western style bank of Yokohama. Note also that Bashamichi (literal translation: horse carriage street) was the first street in Japan to have gas fired street lightings, which were re-installed lately. Bashamichi Station is surrounded by historical buildings, built only a century ago, but for Japanese standards are a true catapulting into westernization. Thus all buildings remaining (partially rebuilt after the heavy bombings of WWII) are protected as “historical – cultural national treasure.” \n\nNihon-Ōdori Station is similar to Bashamichi Station. Nihon-Ōdori (meaning Japan Avenue) is a two lane-two way avenue, which back then separated the living quarters of the foreign delegation and Japanese. The line runs parallel to the Keihin-Tohoku Line, but due to its massive expenses in keeping the designer-class stations running, the fares are rather pricey but definitely worthwhile. The line runs through the very historical parts of Yokohama, when Japan opened up towards the Western civilization. Many history-related museums of Yokohama are dotted along the line, and to attract further tourists, the line offers a one-day unlimited ride ticket (¥450 for adults, 1\/2 price for children).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Yokohama port view.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["View of Yokohama skyline and passenger port"]]},"\n\nYokohama is not a very automobile-friendly place, especially for foreigners.

The pub is trying hard to look as Irish\/American as can be and is doing a very good job. The bartenders know over 200 cocktails and the  “financial damage” per drink hovers around ¥1000. Basic food, pasta, pizza and snacks are also available. Unique about the bar is its size, which can be classed as rather large in the area of Bashamichi, Kannai, where small, tiny sized bars are common. There is no live band, but the music jamming out of the speaker systems throughout the bar is Jazz and the bar itself is very quiet and emphasis is placed on enjoying your drink.
