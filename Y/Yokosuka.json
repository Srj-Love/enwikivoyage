Commodore Matthew Perry's landing in the area in the 1850s initiated the country's modernization, and today it is the site of a major naval facility used by the United States and Japanese forces. During World War Two, it was spared the heavy bombing which was the fate of many other Japanese cities, as the US military had already chosen it as a post-war base location.\nYokosuka city is on the coast and near to sea. The population is about 420,000 in Yokosuka city .There is a Naval Base, so many people come from America. The city's famous foods are ",{"type":"''","value":["Kaigun"]}," (Navy) curry and radish.

(2 hours; ¥3930 [¥3310 JR fare + ¥620 Keikyu fare]). With the Japan Rail Pass this trip costs only ¥620 for the Keikyu line.\n\nRegular JR commuter trains depart Narita Airport once per hour: some trains offer one-seat rides to JR Yokosuka station, or else change at wherever the train terminates to the next train bound for Yokosuka or Kurihama (About 2 3\/4 hours, ¥2520). These trains offer a ¥950 Green Car seating upgrade; Green cars feature more comfortable seats and a drink and snack service.\n\nA cheaper ride from Narita to Yokosuka is to take the ",{"type":"''","value":["Narita Sky Access"]}," train which runs into the subway. When you reach Sengakuji, change to a Keikyu Limited Express train for Yokosuka-Chuo (2 1\/2 hours, ¥2020).\n\nFrom Haneda Airport, take any Keikyu Line local (普通) or express (急行) train and change at Keikyu-Kamata station to a limited express (特急\/快特) towards Yokohama.

If you wish to use JR, be sure to take any train bound for Yokosuka or Kurihama (and note that the front 4 cars of the train are removed at Zushi when Yokosuka-bound, so ask if you are not sure where to sit).\n\nLocal buses connect Yokosuka-Chuo and JR Yokosuka stations on a frequent basis (¥170).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bus"]},"\nBuses run often & until about 11:30 PM; they are very safe, clean & modern; many bus routes go either to and\/or from train stations to connect the transportation network.  They cost about ¥170-¥300 on average.\n\nAt train stations, there will be a master bus map in front of bus stops showing the different routes with bus numbers.  This bus number will only stop at one of several bus stops in front of the station or near the station.  Each stop has a large sign that lists all the buses & schedules for that stop.\n\nAlong the road, bus stops are usually spaced out several blocks apart & are denoted by a white round sign or 4-sided square sign, sometimes lit.  Bus drivers are very conscientious to look and stop for passengers waiting.  The bus stops will be announced along the route and show on an electronic display. Passengers push the \"stop\" button located at every seat to indicate their stop. \n\nGet on at the door halfway down the bus & get off at the front door.  It's easiest to pay with Pasmo\/Suica contactless smart cards, but if using cash, take the small-white ticket from the dispenser as you enter, paying the amount displayed on the price screen which corresponds to the number on your ticket.

Taxis with yellow placard on front grill have permit to enter base & many drivers at JR station will ask foreigners (if going to) \"base-u?\" to ensure a permitted cab is used.
