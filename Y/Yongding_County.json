There are about 80 million Hakka spread out over those provinces and among overseas Chinese; in China they mainly inhabit relatively isolated mountain regions — the fertile valleys were already taken when they arrived — and Yongding County is part of such a region. They have their own language, called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hakka phrasebook"],["Hakka"]]}," in English and ",{"type":"''","value":["kejia hua"]}," in Mandarin.\n\nA tulou is a structure where a number of residences are built inside a single fortified compound. Hakka people have been building these since the 12th century, and in the last couple of centuries some of their non-Hakka neighbours have built some as well. There are now more than 20,000 of them in this county and adjacent areas.\n\nThe people in the area are friendly, tourist infrastructure is minimal, the countryside is extremely beautiful, and there are no large tour buses - which makes for a very pleasant contrast with other touristed rural areas in China.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Tianluokeng_Tulou_Cluster.JPG"],["thumb"],["400px"],["Tianluokeng Tulou Cluster"]]},"\nTulou generally housed a whole clan (a few dozen households, up to 800 people) and are three to five floors high; most are circular, up to about 70 m (200-odd feet) in diameter. They were designed for easy defense; you can see the openings for archers or riflemen on the upper floors but lower floors have no windows. The walls are typically a mixture of packed earth, lime and straw and about 150 cm (5 feet) thick, or a bit more. Other materials including stone, brick and bamboo are also sometimes used. There is usually only one gate, thick oak covered with steel plates, and there is a well and food storage to withstand a siege if necessary.\n\nMost of these tulou are still in use, but the area has suffered an extreme population drain as the able-bodied have generally moved to coastal cities as migrant workers, leaving behind a population of the very old and the very young.  The villages also contain modern housing, and older houses that are not tulou.\n\nAn amusing bit of historical trivia is that in Cold War days when the US first began getting satellite photos (initially, with poor resolution), intelligence analysts spotted many fairly large circular structures in this region, not far from Taiwan. They took them for missile silos and a considerable kerfuffle ensued in the American and Taiwanese military. Eventually they got spies in on the ground and found that the structures were tulou.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Wenchanglou-gate.jpg"],["thumb"],["Entrance to a tulou"]]},"\n\nThe easiest and most convenient way to get to the tulou is from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xiamen"]]}," by direct bus.

Your guesthouse can help organise this for you, or else just walk around and some local will come up offering their service. Prices range from ¥100 to ¥120 for a half day tour. Be sure to negotiate a price before the tour. Most tours allow you to choose 4 or 5 tulous to visit and a car with driver, who also acts as impromptu guide is ¥200, (2011 pricing) A motorbike with rider is ¥120 and would therefore be expensive and uncomfortable if there are two or more of you. You are not allowed to rent or ride a bike. While you will not be hurried, starting the tour at 07:00 will mean you will be back at your lodging well before lunch time. There's no tour that operates by half day or full day. Just select one from the menu and you are on your way.\n\nIf your budget allows, it is fairly easy to arrange a tour with a guide who can serve as translator; if possible, choose one who speaks Hakka as well as Mandarin.
