As of the 2001 census, the population of York was 181,000.\n\nYork is frequently ranked (often vying with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester"]]},") the second most visited city in England after ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},", and is of course famous for giving its name to the city and state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"],["New York"]]}," in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:York cathedra.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["York Minster"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n\nYork was known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Eboracum"]}," by the Romans, who founded the fortress city on the River Ouse in the year 71. York was home first to the Ninth Legion and later the Sixth. York quickly became one of the most important cities in Roman Britain, and after 211 became the capital of the province ",{"type":"''","value":["Britannia Inferior"]},". Constantine the Great—later responsible for making Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire—was first proclaimed Emperor in the city.\n\nCaptured by the Vikings 866, the city quickly took on a new identity as ",{"type":"''","value":["Jorvik"]}," (pronounced \"Yor-vik\") and experienced a major urban revival as a centre of Viking trade and settlement in northern England. The Coppergate excavations of the 1970s revealed much of this Viking past.\n\nYork is a fairly small city - four days is enough to see the major sights although York is a city that reveals its charms to explorers with curiosity and patience.\n\nYork is known as England's \"City of Festivals\" as there are regular cultural festivals every year. The official festivals are the Viking Festival, the Festival of Angels, Early Music, Late Music, Horse Racing (the \"Ebor Race Meeting\"), Multicultural Food and Arts, Chinese New Year, Mystery Plays, Christmas St Nicholas' Fair, and the Food and Drink Festival. It's a romantic city for a weekend break. York is full of magic and a wonderful place to bring children!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nMost travellers will arrive in York by road (car or bus) or rail from other parts of the UK or an airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\nAlthough York is not directly on any of the main north-south motorways, the connections are reasonably good. From the south, the quickest route is probably to take the M1 northbound to junction 32, then the M18 eastbound to junction 2, the A1M northbound to junction 44 and finally the A64 eastbound to the York Outer Ring Road (A1237). Alternatively, you can take the M1 all the way to the A64, but the upper reaches of the M1 around Sheffield and Leeds can get very congested, especially in the rush hours. From the west, the A59 and the M62 provide connections from Liverpool and Manchester, and from the north the A1 and the A19 link York with Tyneside, Northumberland and south-eastern Scotland.\n\nDriving into the city centre itself is something to avoid. Traffic congestion on the main arterial roads serving the city (especially the A19 on Bootham and the Inner Ring Road) can get very bad, especially during the rush hours and on Saturday mornings. The remodelling of some roads near bottleneck junctions to accommodate bicycle lanes has made traffic jams even worse still in recent years, and parking in the city centre is very expensive.\n\nIf you are just visiting York for the day, using a Park and Ride ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.york.gov.uk\/parking\/ride\/"]}," costs a lot less than trying to park in or near the city centre, and there are five sites dotted around the Outer Ring Road. However, the last buses from the city centre leave at around 8pm in the evenings and you are not allowed to leave your car in a Park and Ride overnight. Therefore, if you are staying overnight in York and arriving by car, make sure that your hotel offers parking before you book. If you are only visiting for the day but staying until late evening, you will need to use a city centre car park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By train "]},"\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Wikivoyage has a guide to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rail travel in the United Kingdom"]]},"."]},"\n\nYork is one of the main hubs of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rail travel in the United Kingdom"],["UK rail network"]]},", with a large range of services and destinations to choose from.

If you take into account the time it takes to get from a London airport to King's Cross station, either way will normally take you between four and five hours from the arrivals hall to York city centre.

The low-cost carriers (LCCs) Jet2 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jet2.com\/"]}," and Ryanair ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ryanair.com\/"]}," operate extensive services throughout Europe. KLM is currently the only legacy airline offering hub-and-spoke connections worldwide, via its three daily flights to and from Amsterdam. In light traffic, it takes about an hour by road to York using the A658 and the A59, but often the journey timeis two hours. This route can get very congested around the outskirts of Harrogate during the rush hours, and there are several villages with 30 mph speed limits along the way. York residents collecting arriving passengers should note that it costs £12 an hour if you need to park and go into the terminal building (like if the flight is delayed): you are allowed to wait at the pick-up and drop-off area for only 10 min. There is no direct public transport to York. The best way is to take the 757 bus outside the airport to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leeds"]]}," and then the 743, 800, 840, 843, 844, 845, X40 or X45 to York.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester Airport"]]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["MAN"]]},"), 84 mi by road from York, is the UK's largest airport outside London and offers a wider choice of LCC and legacy airline services worldwide. These include direct flights from the USA operated by American, Delta, and United. By road, the journey using the M62 and the A64 takes about an hour and a half in average traffic, but if you get caught in the rush hours around Leeds and Bradford it can take a lot longer. Train services provide connections to York throughout the day and night (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["York#By train"],["by train"]]}," above), with a typical journey time of just under two hours. It is worth booking tickets for rail connections online in advance, because 'turn up and ride' tickets are often a lot more expensive and if you are travelling at peak times without a reserved seat, you may have to stand for most if not all of the journey (these trains also serve commuters to Manchester and Leeds, and can get very crowded).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Doncaster-Sheffield"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["DSA"]]},"), 41 mi by road from York - mainly serving European holiday destinations.

This route takes you across the Humber Bridge, which is a spectacular sight in itself, but it can get congested in the rush hours. This airport is not easily accessible by public transport. You can take a bus to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kingston upon Hull"],["Hull"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grimsby"]]}," stations.

The airport was formally called Teesside International until it was renamed in 2004, and the name \"Teesside\", \"Tees-side\" or \"Teesside Airport\" still appears on many local road signs, and on tickets and boarding passes issued outside the UK. Although air fares to Durham-Tees Valley can be on the pricey side, it is well worth considering as a starting point for visiting north-east England: as an underused regional airport, waiting and queuing times are very low. However, to recoup the lost revenue from falling passenger numbers in recent years, the airport introduced a \"facility fee\" of £6 per departing passenger (which must be paid before you are allowed through the security check) in December 2010. If you take the A67 eastbound from the airport through Yarm and Kirklevington and then join the A19 southbound to York, this route is hardly ever congested, even during weekday rush hours. Using public transport, a bus goes to Darlington station though there is a dedicated railway station with services to Darlington, they are very infrequent.

These are the outlying suburbs of Tang Hall, Bell Farm, and parts of Foxwood and Clifton but even these are relatively tame compared to similar areas in cities like Manchester or Leeds. Also try to avoid secluded cycle paths at night as it is not unknown (but still fairly rare) for robberies to take place in these parts, however this tends to be away from the main city centre.\n\nThe centre of town, however, is as civilised as everywhere else in Britain.\n\nTake care on weekend evenings in York. Plenty of local youngsters overestimate their capacity for alcohol and the city centre can seem to be awash with lager louts, mainly over the river in the Micklegate area. If you are approached just keep on walking and they will find another victim to pester. Aim for our recommended pubs, though, and you'll find that safe socialising in the company of affable locals is still possible!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Go next "]},"\nYork is centrally located for the Vale of York and East and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Yorkshire"]]},", making it a great base for days out in any direction:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Aldborough Roman Villa"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.english-heritage.org.uk\/daysout\/properties\/aldborough-roman-site\/"],["email="],["address=Aldborough, Boroughbridge, YO51 9ES"],["lat=54.090593"],["long=-1.38008"],["directions="],["phone=+44 1423 322768"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=adults £3.50, children £2.10, concessions £3.20"],["content=It`s a bit of a push to the top of the county but well worth the trouble"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.castlehoward.co.uk\/ Castle Howard"]}]}," - one of the locations for the filming of Brideshead Revisited, this amazing stately home is a great day trip out of York.
