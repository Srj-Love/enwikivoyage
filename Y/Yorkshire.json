Little did he realize that northern England had not been fully subjugated and that the cathedral's construction would require a campaign of genocide (known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Harrying of the North"]},") against the not so friendly locals.\n\nThe overthrow of King Richard II in 1399 led to antagonisms between the Royal houses of York and Lancaster which came to a head in the Wars of the Roses, a 20 year series of conflicts. The Yorkists lost the war at the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 but had the consolation of hosting and winning the bloodiest battle ever on English soil, the Battle of Towton (near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Selby"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Yorkshire"]]},"), in which 28,000 people died.\n\nLeeds' industrial history took form in the 16th and 17th centuries as it was a regional centre of wool processing. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Huddersfield"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kingston upon Hull"],["Hull"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sheffield"]]}," were also important wool centres.

This greatly changed the way of life for many people who moved to crowded cities that lacked the infrastructure to support them. Cholera outbreaks were a big risk.\n\nThe 20th century saw the decline of the industrial centres, many of which spent several decades in the economic wilderness.
