The area is a national park, world-famous for its picturesque combination of rolling hills, woodland, wild moorland, dramatic landscapes and gentle valleys that create unique and beautiful vistas. There are many opportunities for great walks and the lovely little Dales towns and villages provide a glimpse into traditional old-fashioned Yorkshire life.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe Dales is a collection of river valleys and the hills between them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe Romans left traces of marching camps, forts and roads through the area. The influence of later settlers such as the Anglo Saxons and Vikings are most obvious through the place names they left behind them. After the Norman invasion the Dales, like the rest of the country, were covered with a network of monastic buildings. Bolton Priory and Fountains Abbey, at their peak, controlled up to three-quarters of the Dales. In late medieval and Tudor times the Dales saw the building of castles such as Castle Bolton and hunting lodges such as Barden Tower.\n\nThe Industrial revolution and Victorian eras had a huge impact on the Yorkshire Dales, leading to an increase in the mining of local resources such as lead and coal and the building of many of the area's stone buildings, particularly the mills. Transport was improved with the building of turnpike roads and the settle to Carlisle railway with its stunning viaducts and tunnels.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nAlthough tourism is becoming increasingly important, the Yorkshire dales is a working agricultural landscape that has produced a typical form of dry stone walls and field barns. The major natural landscapes include limestone grassland in Wharfedale, Ribblesdale, Littondale and Malham,  moorland, which covers most of the high land in the Dales, hay meadows, found in Swaledale, Upper Wharfedale, Littondale and Upper Wensleydale and limestone pavements, found around Wharfedale, to the north of Malham and Ingleborough. Rivers and riverbanks are also plentiful although woodland comprises just 1% of the Dales landscape and is mainly confined to steep slopes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nAs with the rest of the UK, winter (October–March) can be wet, cold (−5°C–15°C) and windy, and summer (June–August) can be warm and sunny (18°C–28°C).
