Yosemite is internationally recognized for its spectacular granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, and biological diversity. The 750,000-acre, 1,200 square-mile park contains thousands of lakes and ponds, 1600 miles of streams, 800 miles of hiking trails, and 350 miles of roads.  It is currently the third most visited national park in the United States, with an annual visitation of nearly 4 million.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nEfforts to protect Yosemite Valley began as far back as June 30, 1864 when President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill granting Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias to the State of California as an inalienable public trust. This was the first time in history that a federal government had set aside scenic lands simply to protect them and to allow for their enjoyment by all people. The area became a national park on October 1, 1890 following several years of struggle by John Muir against the devastation of the subalpine meadows surrounding Yosemite Valley.\n\nDespite its national park status, California controlled the initial grant area until 1906.  Prior to ceding control, the city of San Francisco became embroiled in a bitter political struggle over the Hetch Hetchy Valley, in which the city wanted to dam the Tuolumne River as a source of drinking water and hydroelectric power. In 1913, conservationists led by John Muir lost the battle when Congress passed the Raker Act, authorizing the construction of O'Shaughnessy Dam.  To this day crusades to restore Hetch Hetchy are ongoing.\n\nYosemite has grown from a little visited, yet historically significant, park to one of the \"crown jewels\" of the US National Park System.  With this stature comes difficulties; current visitation numbers roughly 4 million visitors per year, with a majority visiting 12 square miles within Yosemite Valley (about 1% of the total park land).  The dual role of the park service -- protection of the resource and provide for the enjoyment of the visitor -- makes sure that Yosemite continues to be an important breeding ground for management ideas about US National Parks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["The Flood of 1997"],["Warm winter temperatures, a late-season tropical rainstorm, and a heavy snow pack combined to produce the greatest flooding on record in Yosemite Valley in January of 1997.  A highly unusual winter rainstorm arrived in January, and the rainfall caused tremendous melting of the existing High Sierra snowpack.  The resulting flood of rain and melted snow caused the Merced River to rise nearly ten feet above its normal level, producing over $178 million in damage in Yosemite Valley.  As a result the Valley was closed for over three months, and vast changes were made to the area's management plan.  Today numerous structures have been relocated, roads have been re-routed out of the flood plain, and nearly fifty percent of campsites have been removed.  Signs indicating the floodwater height are posted throughout the Valley."]]},"\n\nYosemite is best known for the massive granite cliffs and domes found within the park.  The landscape began forming about ten million years ago when the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and then tilted to form its relatively gentle western slopes and the more dramatic eastern slopes.  The uplift increased the steepness of stream and river beds, resulting in formation of deep, narrow canyons. About one million years ago, snow and ice accumulated, forming glaciers at the higher alpine meadows that moved down the river valleys. Ice thickness in Yosemite Valley may have reached 4,000 feet during the early glacial episode. The downslope movement of the ice masses cut and sculpted the U-shaped valley that attracts so many visitors to its scenic vistas today.\n\nThe park is also home to the Yosemite Falls, at 739m (2425ft), the highest ",{"type":"[[","value":[["waterfalls"],["waterfall"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North America"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nYosemite has more than 300 species of vertebrate animals, and 85 of these are native mammals.

Visitor education and bear management efforts have reduced the bear-human incidents and property damage by 90% in the past few years. Ungulates include large numbers of mule deer. Bighorn sheep formerly populated the Sierra crest, but have been reduced to only a few remnant populations. There are 17 species of bats, 9 of which are either Federal or California Species of Special Concern. Over 150 species of birds regularly occur in the parks. Other species that are found within the park include bobcat, gray fox, mountain beaver, great gray owls, white-headed woodpeckers, spotted owls, golden-mantled ground squirrel, martens, Steller's jays, pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed hare, and coyotes.\n\nThe vegetation in the park is primarily coniferous forest.

While not the larger grizzly bears that once roamed California, black bears are strong enough to tear a door off of a car with ease.  Luckily they usually prefer to avoid humans, so they'll most likely do their work on vehicles left at trailheads or in parking lots.

Leaving even just a tube of toothpaste or empty food wrappers in a car may result in thousands of dollars of damage to your vehicle should a bear choose to investigate the smell!  Bear-resistant storage units are provided at park campgrounds and overnight parking areas:  use them.\n\nTo avoid bear encounters while hiking, make noise so that the animal knows you are coming.  This approach will also help to avoid encounters with mountain lions, which also inhabit the park.  Other animals, such as the herds of deer which can be found in the park's meadows, can be equally dangerous; a young boy was killed by a deer in Yosemite Valley several years ago.  Give all animals their space, and never feed any park wildlife.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Light"]},"\nYosemite Lodge (and possibly other accommodation areas) has no outside lighting.

Hypothermia can be a concern at higher elevations where temperatures can drop below freezing throughout the year.  Dress in layers, and be prepared for storms and rapid changes in temperature.  When storms are approaching avoid open areas such as the summits of the park's many granite domes; lightning strikes these areas regularly.  If a storm does approach, get off of high, open ground.  When hiking wear sturdy footwear and drink plenty of water - if you are thirsty that is an early sign of dehydration.  Be aware that the sun can be intense at higher elevations and when reflected off of snow, so sunscreen is important.  In the winter, take the weather term \"Winter Storm Warning\" very seriously as it means a significant storm is definitely coming.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On the trails"]},"\n\nHikers should follow all posted signs - if a trail is closed due to ice, landslide, or some other reason do not ignore the closure as doing so endangers both the hiker and any area that must be traversed to go around the closure.  On the Half Dome trail hikers should ALWAYS remain inside the cables for both their ascent and descent - people have died on this section of trail as recently as Summer 2009.\n\nThe park's waterfalls pose another potential hazard.  Do not attempt to get close to the waterfalls, especially in the spring.  This includes swimming above the waterfalls at a distance of less than 1 mile (about 1600 meters) The force of the water will easily sweep a person off their feet and over the falls. Being swept over any of Yosemite's waterfalls is invariably fatal.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Other Concerns"]},"\n\nCurrently, the greatest danger in the park comes from the thousands of park visitors.  Petty thieves and traffic accidents are two issues to be aware of.  Follow park speed limits, lock your vehicle, and be aware of your belongings, especially in Yosemite Valley.  Violent crime is extremely rare in Yosemite, but given the numbers of people that visit you should expect that a few unsavory characters will be visiting too.\n\nThe National Park Service provides the primary law enforcement and fire protection in the park.

They coordinate as best as possible, considering they are a half-hour away from each other.  They process thousands of items each year and surprisingly get a number of items back to the rightful owner.  Because of the thousands of items lost or found, generally, you will not get a return call unless your item has been found and turned in correctly.\n\nItems that are found that cannot be returned to the owner are generally turned over to recognized charities.
