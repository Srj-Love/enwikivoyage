There are many opportunities for opal shopping in town.\n\nThe Yowah nut is the local opal.  Small rocks on the ground reveal the opal colouring when cut.  The local miners can see which of the rocks are likely to contain a nut.  You can get your own fossicking cut for a fee as well (you won't know if you've found a true nut until it is cut).\n\nYou can purchase them in the rough, or as fine jewellery, or in pretty much any state in between.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nYou can get food at the ",{"type":"'''","value":["General Store"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Short and Sweet"]}," (follow the pink signs into town).
