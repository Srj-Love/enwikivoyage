The sprawling waters of Yuba State Park provide a variety of recreation opportunities for visitors. Warm water and sandy beaches, along with nearby off-highway vehicle riding areas, lure visitors during summer months. One of the few state parks with boat-in camping, Yuba is very popular with water recreationers.  Two boat ramps, one at Yuba State Park and one at Painted Rocks, provide access for all types of watercraft.  \n\nThe reservoir is a year-round fishery for walleye, perch, catfish, rainbow trout and northern pike.  Other activities include camping, hiking, picnicking, rock hounding, bird watching, interpretive and junior ranger programs, mountain biking, and waterfowl hunting in season.\n\nAt an elevation of 5,100 feet (1,555 m), Yuba State Park is 25 miles south of Nephi, just off Interstate 15.  The reservoir, when full, is 22 miles (35 km) long and reaches a maximum depth of 80 feet (24 m).  Yuba Reservoir is the largest of many water impoundments on the Sevier River with a capacity of 250,000 acre feet of water.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Day-use fee: $8"]},{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Cabins"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price=$60"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Oasis Campground"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price=$20 (no hookups); $25 (electric and water hookups)"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Painted Rocks Campground"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price=$20 (electric and water hookups);  $16 (no hookups)"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Eagle View Campground"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price=$16 (no dock); $20 (with boat dock)"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central Utah"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["39.269"],["-111.898"],["zoom=12"],["layer=OD"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Yuba State Park"]]}]
