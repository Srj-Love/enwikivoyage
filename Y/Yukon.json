The distances between service stations can be vast; make sure your vehicle is in good condition, and prepare for the worst.  Drive for the conditions and expect to see large animals in the middle of the highway.  Obtain a good highway map of the territory as soon as possible.  A free map titled \"Canada's Yukon Highway Map\", found at visitor centres and some service stations, classifies roads into primary (90-100km\/h), secondary (70-90km\/h), and local (50-80km\/h), as well as paved, dust treated, and untreated.  This information will be of great use when selecting a route suitable for you and your vehicle.\n\nIf the thought of driving such long distances doesn't thrill you, consider crossing some distances in the sky (but note that this can be quite expensive).

The Yukon Liquor Corporation operates 6 liquor stores in the territory.  These are located in Whitehorse, Watson Lake, Dawson, Haines Junction, Faro, and Mayo.  Alcohol is also available from \"off-sales\" of bars.  There is a 30% premium for purchasing from off-sales. The liquor stores in the rural communities also operate as government agents and provide services such as driver licences, fishing licences, motor vehicle registrations, property taxes, business licences and court fines. If you require all of these in a single trip you receive a Yukon Yoddeller award.\n\nSome communities in the North are officially \"Dry\" communities.
