It is the largest of all Taoist temples remaining from the Yuan Dynasty.  This important Taoist temple complex was not always located where it is now; it was moved brick-by-brick, painting-by-painting from 1959 - 1964 to allow for the construction of the Sanmen Gorge Reservoir on the Yellow River.  Fortunately, the priceless murals for which the palace is best known were well preserved in the move.  The original monastery was built between 1247 and 1262 to commemorate Lu Dongbin, one of the eight Taoist imortals, who was born in the town of Yongle in 789.  The full complex took 111 years to build and was complted in 1358.  The palace comprises of several buildings constructed along a line running from south to north.  In each of the main halls, the walls are covered by vivid paintings which are considered the most outstanding examples of Taoist painting in China."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Guan_Di_Temple_Yuncheng_Shanxi.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Guan Di Temple."]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Guan Di Temple"],["alt=Guan Yu Temple"],["url="],["email="],["address=In Xiezhou Town, 20 km west of Yuncheng"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=There are countless Guan Di temples in China and overseas, but the Guan Di Temple in Shanxi's Xiezhou County is undoubtedly the finest and most famous.  This is because Guan Yu (often called the \"God of War\" in the West),to whom the temple is dedicated, was born in nearby Changping Village, making this a logical place for the main ancestral temple honoring this popular god.  The complex is divided into southern and northern sections.  Visitors first enter from the southern section, which consists primarily of gardens, rockeries, and an archway.  The main part of the Guan Di Temple is in the northern section, which in turn is divided into front and back parts.  the temple was buit by imperial decree in the year 589, during the Sui Dynasty, and resembles a palace, befitting Guan Yu's status as a \"Saintly Emperor\" in the Taoist religion. After passing through the main gate, one proceeds in a straight line from one gate or hall to another.  Built in 1718, the Chongning Hall is the main temple to Guan Yu in the complex.  At the back of the palace is the Spring and Autumn Building, a magnificent wooden structure built during the Ming Dynasty and rebuilt in 1807."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Shanxi"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Yuncheng"]]}]
