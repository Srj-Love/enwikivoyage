The land near the town is almost flat. There are no natural fortifications, and the spot is quite unpractical from the medieval point of view. The choice of this location was motivated by the agricultural importance of the region and the huge trading activity during the Middle Ages: the roads from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vladimir"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Suzdal"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pereslavl Zalessky"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rostov Veliky"]]}," crossed here.

The town was situated in the agricultural region of Vladimir Fields, at the crossing of several trading roads. This advantageous location led to the rapid development. In 1212, Yuryev-Polsky became the center of the small principality that appeared after the defragmentation of Vladimir-Suzdal state. The importance of the town was emphasized by the construction of the white-stone Cathedral of St. George. However, the decay started already in 1238 when the town was destroyed by Batu Khan. Yuryev-Polsky also suffered from further Mongol invasions in 1382 and 1408. The shift of the capital to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," changed the trading activity, and the location of Yuryev-Polsky became less advantageous. Since 14th century, Yuryev-Polsky was considered as a minor settlement on the outskirts of Moscow principality. The town was entrusted to foreign rulers subordinated to Moscow princes. Since 17th century, Yuryev-Polsky is a regular provincial town, standing away from any important roads. The only active road passed from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Suzdal"]]},", but it decayed after the construction of railways, and the town turned to its present, sleepy state.
