It takes a ten minutes walk through the rather dull shopping esplanade (called Gedempte Gracht) to get to the slightly more atmospheric area where you can find the pubs and restaurants. That area, with streets like the Zuiddijk and Prins Hendrikkade, is located at the waterfront of the river Zaan.\n\nIn all honesty, the centre of Zaandam is not very special, except for a few nice pubs and a venue with live music. The centre is currently a big construction site, as the town council is putting a big effort in reconstructing and rebuilding the city centre under the name \"project Inverdan\". This project consists of the building of a complete new town hall adjecent to the railway station, a brand new hotel which looks like a pile of wooden houses from the Zaan Region, a shopping mall\/apartment complex (Hermitage) and bringing the water back in the Gedempte Gracht shopping mall.\n\nYou can explore the typical Dutch landscape with completely flat meadows and windmills around the city. The Zaan Region is possibly the oldest industrial area in the world (as it was not driven by steam but by wind), and it is shown in many old buildings.
