The chance of getting in trouble in Zagreb is fairly low, especially in the center where most of the hotels and restaurants are located, and for foreigners who are in general respected and welcome. Visitors soon realize that Zagreb is way safer than the vast majority of other European capitals such as London, Paris, Vienna, Rome, Budapest, etc.\n\nPickpocketing isn't a particularly common occurrence in Zagreb, but you might be approached by beggars and similar people on the street - ignore them and they will go away.\n\nAlso, outbursts of homophobic behaviour have been known to occur, so it is adviseable for homosexual couples not to show affection when near large groups of bald people or people that look like football hooligans. A lesbian couple from UK was assaulted by an angry passanger in a tram, and they suffered minor injuries, and the perpetrator was apprehanded by the police. Watch out for aggressive people like that one.\n\nPark Ribnjak, located very close to the city centre, is safe during daytime and worth visiting, especially for children. However, it has recently become a night-time meeting place of alternative youngsters, and subculture violence involving \"skinheads\" and similar violent young people has occasionally occurred. It's best to steer clear of Ribnjak after dark, which shouldn't be a problem because of a lack of interesting content for most tourists anyway.\n\nFurther, if you are going out at night (especially on weekends) steer clear of any drunk and rowdy groups of young people you might encounter in the street or night trams as random beatings have been known to occur. It is not uncommon for such groups to start unprovoked attacks on passersby, although they target mainly younger crowd and teenagers. These are not common but they do happen occasionally, and people have been killed by such attacks in the past, so take precautions. It is adviseable for men not to wear overly pink clothes.\n\nAvoid clubs which play what is known in Croatia as \"Turbo-folk\" music. These clubs are often featured in the local newspapers as violence erupts in them quite easily.\n\nAlso, ",{"type":"'''","value":["avoid strip clubs at all costs"]},". Zagreb is not famous for such clubs and they are rare, however most of them are often run by very shady characters, and often overcharge their guests. Recent cases include foreigners that were charged €2000 for a bottle of champagne. These clubs overcharge their customers to the extreme, and their bouncers will not have any mercy if you tell them you are unable to pay. You will soon find yourself in a local hospital.
