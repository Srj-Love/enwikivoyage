They have five terminals that are located in different cities - Caloocan, Cubao, Kamias, Pasay and Sampaloc. With the exception of the Kamias terminal, only the four others have trips to Olongapo and Iba. \n \nThe nearest from the three international airports in Manila is the Pasay Terminal located along EDSA, Pasay City.  From there, itâ€™s a 5 hour bus ride, depending on the traffic, to Iba, the capital of Zambales. Available buses are aircon and non-aircon. One way fare from the Pasay terminal is 346 pesos (according to Victory Liner website, subject to fare increase). The first trip leaves at 5:00am however, based from experience, the time of departure changes from time to time. \n \nAnother option is to hop on a bus to Olongapo from either Pasay, Cubao, Sampaloc or Caloocan, since the frequency of trips per day are more. Upon arrival at the terminal of Victory Liner Olongapo, you can transfer to one of the buses going to Iba or Sta. Cruz. Sta.
