Recommendable and for sure unforgettable.\n\nZambia is a big country (as big as France) and the public roads are pretty fair for a normal car. Sometimes there are deep potholes (holes in the road), but they are avoidable if you do not drive too fast. Most Zambians drive in a controlled way, sometimes a little too fast. Be especially aware for buses and trucks. They are wide and very long and drive far too fast. If you see a truck or bus approaching, then drive slower and keep left as left as you can. They tend to use your half of the road, pushing you off the road. \nIf you want to see more of Zambia, you will need a good 4x4 four wheel drive car. Especially from December until early April at times rain falls and the roads are wet and muddy.\nZambia is a wonderful country, lovely paople, full of stunning nature and wildlife. The most well known parks in Zambia are Kafue (West of Lusaka) and South Luangwa (East of Lusaka). South Luangwa is known and acknowledged to be one of the most beautiful wildlife parks in all Africa. \nMost National Parks in Zambia, like South Luangwa National Parl (SLNP), can be visited with your privat car. However, to enjoy this to the full, you will need a 4x4 car.\n\nThe South Luangwa National Park is surrounded by the so-called GMA’s (Game Management Areas). You will find only limited habitation and you will be able to see an abundance of wildlife, like, lions, leopards, elephants, girafs, etc. A recommendable tour is from Petauke to Malama, on to Mfuwe and to the Nsefu sector (or the other way around). This route can only be done with a well equipped 4x4 car. You will see and enjouy to the full, the true rural Africa, the local people and their villages and wildlife.\nFrom Lusaka you take the road to Chipata (Great Eastern Road) and from that road (well before Chipata) take the junction to Petauke. Once you drove through Petauke you will go off the tarred road on a very fair gravel road. After 60km on this road, you turn left followed by a 120km local rural road to Malama Chiefdom and Mfuwe. The road is really not too bad. On the way you will have to go over some steep hills, but you will manage. When you go under the electricity network cables (ZESCO Main Power Lines), you enter the Malama Chiefdom and will be only 15km away from the junction. This junction will lead (via the Malama Chief’s Palace) you either to the Lusangazi Gate of the National Park (left) or onwards direction Mfuwe (right). The junction is at a little village. If you are able and willing to do so: The people here and in the villages around the Chief’s Palace, are very friendly and helpful. Leave something for them. It will be highly appreciated because the local people are poor.\n\nIf you head for Mfuwe, you will find a campsite after 9km along the Luangwa River, called Malama Umoyo Camp. It is near (1,5km after) the scouts training center. This (basic) campsite is located at a stunning location overlooking the Luangwa River and a dry lagoon, most of the time filled with wildlife.\nYour hosts here are Menno en Virginie. From here it is also possible to make a daytrip to the National Park. \n\nFrom Malama Umoyo Camp it is 42km (2,5 hours drive) to Mfuwe. Mfuwe is a local but bigger than normal village. In the Mfuwe area you will find a lot of lodges, but also a good campsite. Recommendable is Croc Valley Camp. If you arrive from Malama and hit the tarred road, you turn left after 3km and after a few hundred meters right off the tarred road on to a gravelled road. Signposts will lead you further to Croc Valley Camp. Your hosts at Croc Valley Camp are Shaun and Milly. From here it is only a 5 minute drive to the main gate of the South Luangwa National Park (SLNP).\nEntree fee for the SLNP is USD 25 per person per 24 hours and USD 35 for a privat car entering the park. At 06:00 the park is open and for privat cars it is open until 18:00 hours. \nFrom Mfuwe\/Croc Valley Camp you can proceed to the Nsefu sector. Do not forget to fill your fuel tank in Mfuwe. You follow the tarred road to Chipata and the local airport and after about 12km from Mfuwe (the cropping it is called) you turn left (you will see a signpost and two palm trees). After about 12km you will reach the gate of the National Park. If you are going to camp, then tell at the gate that you are on your way to Zikomo camp. Zikomo Camp is just outside the borders of the park. Right after the gate you turn left and follow the road (about 4 to 5 km) to Zikomo Camp. Your host at the camp is Demian Wallace. The Nsefu sector is part of the SNLP and considered by many as the most beautiful part of the park.\nAfter visiting Mfuwe, you can then return to Chipata (about 2 hours drive). Chipata is the capital of the Eastern Province and a good place to buy supplies and refuel. There are two supermarkets and lots of shops. Opposite Total fuel station you can find Afroc. Here you can refill camping gaz.\nFrom Chipata it is a 20 minutes drive to the Malawi border.\nCrossing the border will take about half an hour. When entering Malawi, you have to fill in a TIP form for your car and pay Malawi Kwacha 5,000. This will allow your car in Malwai for 30 days. Do not forget to insure your car for Malawi, because they check on it frequently. Just after the border there is an insurance company. Try to get Malawi Kwachas before you enter the border post because they only accept Malawi Kwachas and not US dollars or any other currency. At the border there are many money changers. Tip: Take one US 100 note in your hand, put away your wallet, and change this for 100 x 180 Malawi kwacha. Be careful. These guys are quick and often give you less than they say. So you get MKW 18,000 for USD 100. You should a least get a 15% better rate than the official bank rate.\nIf you passed the border it will be another 125km over a good tarred road to Lilongwe. Watch your speed, especially where it says you have to drive 50km.\n\nAlternative route:\n\nFrom Mfuwe there is the possibility to go right through the park to the North. This is a really adventurous road. Do NOT drive this road when it is wet\/raining! When you passed the northern gate, you will reach the escarpment and you have to drive up a very steep road. It can be done by good 4x4 drivers, but do it slowly. Once out of the Luangwa valley you will have a stunning view over the valley. You then can proceed to Mpika. In Mpika you can camp and get new supplies and fuel. From Mpika you can visit Kasanka NP (in November you will be able to see the daily migrations of millions of bats) or you can go up north. Recommended is to visit Shiwa Ngandu. A beautiful mansion built by an excentric British gentleman (Stewart Gore Brown) a 100 years ago in the middle of nowhere. Camping you can near the hot water springs. The water is lovely and relaxing for at least a half hour dip. Mark Harvey and his wife are your hosts here. From here you can proceed for example to Tanzania (to Ruaha NP, also a place not to miss). \n\nPS. When visiting Mfuwe, and you prefer a lodge for a good sleep, dinner and a warm shower: Thornicroft Lodge en Croc Valley are both recommendable (good value for money).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nYou can catch TAZARA line trains between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Kapiri Mposhi"]]}," and Nakonde in the north-east (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tanzania"]]}," border).

As you move into the rural areas, though, expect communication to become more difficult.  Nevertheless, do not be surprised to find a rural Zambian who speaks flawless English.\n\nThe most important thing to remember when speaking to Zambians is to greet them.  When you first approach a Zambian, always begin by asking, \"How are you?\" even if you do not care.  They will consider you very respectful.  \nSport, especially football (soccer) is a very good conversation topic with men; church is a good topic with either gender.  \n\nWherever you happen to be in the country it is a good idea to learn the local way of exchanging greetings, asking for something politely and thanking someone.  These simple phrases will help make life easier.\n\nAfrikaans usage is on a slow but steady rise, mainly because of immigration from South Africa and the ease of learning the language.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" There are national parks scattered across the country."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Victoria Falls"]]}," in southern Zambia is one of the greatest waterfalls in the world, and inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nOriginally, the Kwacha — meaning \"sunrise,\" so-named to celebrate Zambia's independence — was tied to the US dollar, so conversion was simple.  However, in the late-90's, the kwacha was floated and devalued rapidly.  Since mid 2005 the Kwacha re-appreciated strongly, due to the international debt-relief and the boost of the copper prices. As of January 2013, the Kwacha is hovering around $1 = 3.22ZMK, €1 = 4.317MK. As the currency is being re-based (dropping the last three zeros) between January 2013 and June 2013, you can still expect change in both the new re-based currency and the old currency, but ATM's and banks will only issue the new currency (there are helpful posters every where with the new and old notes).\n\nU.S. dollars are still commonly used for larger purchases (although it's illegal) and will be accepted by anybody dealing with tourists.  It is not unusual to see all printed prices at a hotel restaurant in local currency, and then receive a bill in U.S. dollars.  If you bring US$, in Zambia only the \"big heads\" (new notes) are accepted in banks and bureaux de change, small heads are not accepted (if you are lucky you can change them in Livingstone).  U.S. $50 and U.S. $100 notes are the best to bring, for smaller nominations you will get a poorer rate at the bureaux (5-10% less).\n\nChanging ",{"type":"'''","value":["Euros"]}," is a difficult thing to do especially up country, bureaux are giving a very poor rate (25% less than the market rate!). International banks will accept, but with commission charge. Finance Bank, Arcades shopping Centre Lusaka, is known to accept Euro's at a good rate and without commission charge. Bureaux and Banks will only change a maximum of 1000 US$ (or equivalent) per person per day! Watch the rates as they can change overnight, fluctuations of 3-5% per day are common.\n\nSouth African Rand are exchanged relatively easily in major centers. Other second tier currencies like the Australian dollar are not worth bothering with.  Expect blank looks from the locals, and a mocking laugh from those in the tourist trade.\n\nIf you want to ",{"type":"'''","value":["sound like a local"]},", refer to 1000 kwacha as a ",{"type":"'''","value":["pin"]},", so for example 10,000K is \"ten pin\".  In the '90's, the kwacha devalued so rapidly that the government didn't have time to produce new, larger bank notes.  To pay for things, Zambians often had to bundle — or \"pin\" together — large numbers of small bills.  Notes are now available in denominations of up to 50,000K (Till June 2013, as they are being re-based to 50K), but hang on to small change if you can because there are occasional shortages.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["ATM"]},"s may be found in major cities, but you should not depend on them to be functional.  Most of the ATM's accept only VISA. Other international credit cards (like MASTERCARD and AMEX) are generally a problem. Maestro is definitely a problem in Zambia and very few ATM's accept Maestro. Some shops and restaurants might accept ",{"type":"'''","value":["debit"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["credit cards"]},", as do practically all high-end hotels and safari lodges, but surcharges of 5-10% are common.  ATMs only dispense local currency. \n\nAlthough using forms of payment other than cash is growing in popularity, you should not depend on credit to get around the country.  Traveler's cheques are almost impossible to process in Zambia, most chance you will have in the Lusaka international banks (Stanbic, Standard Chartered), but even then you will get a very poor rate, a high commission charge and it will take you a couple of hours, if you are lucky. If you prefer to take the risk and use Traveller's cheques, the only ones who will be accepted (if you are lucky) are the ones from American Express (Thomas Cook's are currently not accepted!).\n\nMost shopkeepers advertise fixed prices and are unwilling to negotiate, but this is not a given.  On the other hand, most \"freelance\" salesmen — vendors selling curios; taxi drivers; etc. — who do not post their prices are usually willing to negotiate.  As a (very) general rule of thumb, assume the first price they mention is at least double the amount they will accept.  You should not be afraid to barter — after all, Zambians bargain among themselves — but try not to get carried away with saving a few pennies.  \n\nTipping is not required — indeed, it was at one point illegal — but often expected.  Porters expect US$0.50 or so per bag, and better restaurants typically add in a 10% service charge or expect an equivalent tip.\n\nFinally, keep in mind the Zambian custom of ",{"type":"''","value":["mbasela"]}," (em-buh-SAY-la) — giving a freebie when more than one item is purchased.

A bare-bones budget traveler will be looking at a minimum of US$40\/day just for a bed and three meals, and transport is (again, comparatively) expensive, in part due to the great distances involved. Foreign currencies just don't go as far as in other developing countries, and often prices in Zambia are the same as what one would be paying in America. At the other end of the spectrum, all-inclusive safari lodges or Lusaka\/Livingstone's five-star hotels will take care of all your needs but charge US$200\/day and up for the privilege.  Finding a middle ground between these two extremes can be difficult but there are safari operators who will offer 'DIY' camping for around US$5 to $95 and above - it pays to look around (see below).\n\nZambian safaris are amongst the best available in Africa; they offer top quality viewing experiences with the continent's top guides.

However, you might find that a white person, of any gender or age, is granted the most respect of all.  A holdover from colonial times, this might make a traveler uncomfortable, but this is largely a Zambian's way of being courteous.  Accept their hospitality.\n\nZambians are a curious people.

This should not be interpreted as anything sexual; they are merely trying to \"connect\" with you.  If you feel uncomfortable, simply pull your hand away.  \nIf you wish to be courteous or show respect then holding your right wrist or elbow with your left hand as you shake is acceptable.  Do not expect a firm handshake as this is considered aggressive, likewise do not be too firm in yours.  \n\nEye contact is also considered aggressive and disrespectful, you can make eye contact but do not hold it, slide your eyes away, but do not face away.\n\nWomen should not wear shorts or mini-skirts, especially as they travel away from Lusaka.  (Thighs, to Zambian men, are huge turn-ons.)  Low-cut tops, however, while discouraged, are not nearly as provocative.  \n\nPointing with the index finger should not be done, it is considered vulgar.\n\nFinally, when meeting a Zambian — even to ask a question — you should always say hello and ask how they are.
