Both ports provide helpful employees. Be gracious and tip properly. Depending on the number of luggage your tip can range from 50 to 200 pesos. The seaport is not as organized and there are a lot  of free-lancers who are willing to help for a fee (sometimes a very hefty fee). Tip only after you have been escorted to your transportation.\n\nFor those who don't have someone to pick them up, there is public transportation readily available. You have your choice of tri-cycles, Jeepneys, or taxi. Taxi would be your best bet. The taxi fare for a 5 kilometer trip would be less than 50 pesos but there aren't that many available.\n\nSecond choice is the tri-cycle. A passenger and luggage traveling a distance of 5 kilometers would cost no  more than 30 pesos. But since you are coming from the port, the tri-cycle drivers want a heftier fare (this is illegal for them because they can lose their license). So usually the fare is bumped up 100%.\n\nTo get a jeepney, the best way is to  have someone (your porter) hire the jeepney for you while you watch over your luggage. Within a 5 kilometer radius a Jeepneys will cost you anywhere from 200 to 300 pesos. This is called a \"special\". The driver will also help you with your luggage.
