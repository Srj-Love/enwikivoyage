Thus, one has to get to Zamora, if travelling by airplane, through one of the bigger cities like Guadalajara or Morelia. Both of which are about two and a half hours away from the city of Zamora. From the airport, one has to either take a taxi (hired inside the airport) or travel, by taxi, to the bus station, which unfortunately is located in the other side of Guadalajara, and thus, it is a very long trip, but it is cheaper than hiring a taxi to get you to Zamora.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Catedral de Zamora Michoac√°n.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["The catedrale in Zamora de Hidalgo."]]},"\n\nZamora is a small town city. Big main plaza surrounded by local commerce, a Cathedral church, and the government palace. Excellent place to visit, particularly during Sundays when there are a lot of people, who come to mingle and congregate in this main plaza during Sundays. There are people selling home made bread, very famous in the region, and organic candy made with real fruit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mid-range"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Splurge"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mid-range"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Splurge"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=Mexican Federal Highway 15.png"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guadalajara"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sahuayo"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Morelia"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zacapu"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Michoacan"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["20.0000"],["-102.3000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Zamora de Hidalgo"]]}]
