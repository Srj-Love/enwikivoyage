Trains leave Zamiin-Uud for Ulaanbaatar on at least a daily basis, as of March 2011 at 17:35 and arrive at 10:00.  You can buy tickets for the train from the top floor black glass building to the left of the main train station building as you face it.  Left luggage is in the basement of this building.\n\nGetting tickets on the same day can be an issue - later on in the day often only soft sleeper and hard seat are available.  At busy times (for instance around the Nadaam) and on days when only one train to Ulaanbaatar runs sometimes soft sleeper sells out as well.  It's best to cross the border as early as possible to ensure a bed.  If you speak Mongolian, you could also try contacting Anda Tour below who can reserve tickets for you.  If you're travelling from Beijing to Ulaanbaatar, you could buy a package from one of the guesthouses in Beijing, but this is probably only worth it around the Naadam.\n\nPrices increased dramatically at the end of 2008 and again for 2011 - it now costs 16,300 MNT (October 2011) for hard sleeper and 40,000 MNT (4\/2011) for soft sleeper to UB and takes 16 hours for the slow train at 17:35.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["image:Bogie Swap at the Mongolia-China Border, Erlian (149199530).jpg"],["thumb"],["Bogie swap at the Chinese Border"]]},"\n\nBelow is the timetable for trains leaving Zamiin-Uud as of July 2009 (some out of date):\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|",{"type":"'''","value":[" Train Number"]}],["| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|",{"type":"'''","value":[" Route"]}],["| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|",{"type":"'''","value":[" Arrives"]}],["| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|",{"type":"'''","value":[" Departs"]}],["| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|",{"type":"'''","value":[" Days"]}],["|-"],["| 3|| ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulaanbaatar"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," (Trans Mongolian) || 00:25 || 01:40 || Thursday"],["|-"],["| 4|| Moscow - Ulaanbaatar - Beijing (Trans Mongolian) || 19:30 || 20:35 || Sunday"],["|-"],["| 23|| Beijing - Ulaanbaatar (Trans Mongolian) || 23:40 || 01:20 || Saturday"],["|-"],["| 24|| Ulaanbaatar - Beijing (Trans Mongolian) || 19:26 || 20:35 || Thursday, Friday"],["|-"],["| 22|| Ulaanbaatar - Zamiin-Uud - Ereen|| 08:00 || 10:00 || Thursday, Sunday"],["|-"],["| 21|| Ereen - Zamiin-Uud - Ulaanbaatar || 18:25 || 22:25 || Monday, Friday"],["|-"],["| 34|| Ulaanbaatar - Zamiin-Uud - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hohhot"]]}," || 08:00 || 10:00 || Monday, Friday"],["|-"],["| 33|| Hohhot - Zamiin-Uud - Ulaanbaatar || 18:25 || 22:25 || Monday, Friday"],["|-"],["| 685\/686 || Zamiin-Uud - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ereen"]]}," || 18:25 || 10:00: || Monday, Friday"],["|-"],["| 681\/682 || Zamiin-Uud - Ereen - Hohhot || 18:25 || 10:00: || Tuesday, Saturday"],["|-"],["| 275, 276 || Zamiin-Uud - Ulaanbaatar || 7:10 || 17:35 || Every day"],["|-"],["| 43,44 || Zamiin-Uud - Ulaanbaatar || 08:00 || 21:25 || Arrives Tues, Wed, Sat, leaves Wed, Thur, Sun"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nWith your back to the station in the rear left of the square there's a building which contains a bank, hotel & restaurant which serves decent food, and a load of eateries around the square.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=taivanbaatar"],["alt=zamiin-uud to ulaanbaatar"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=008613439495998"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=07"],["price=09"],["content=09\/07\/2011 pileta 4"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThe beautiful \"yellow shop\" to the left of the station sells ice cold beer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Jinchiin Hotel"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Near the train station"],["phone=+976 02524553289"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price=10,000 to 30,000T"],["content=Small hotel with about 20 rooms and a simple cafe."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go Next"]},"\nZamiin-Uud is a dusty border town that consists mostly of gers and small wooden houses.
