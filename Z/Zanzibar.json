They are Zanzibar Central\/South, Zanzibar North and Zanzibar Urban\/West. Zanzibar City, on the central west coast, is the capital and largest city of Zanzibar and the region of Zanzibar Urban\/West. The population of Unguja was 984,625 in the census of 2002, with the most concentrated populations located in the Zanzibar Urban region.\n\nThe larger and more populated of Zanzibar's two main islands, Unguja is separated from its northern neighbor Pemba by 48 kilometres of open sea. The mainland of Tanzania, which lies to the southwest of Unguja and is separate from it by the Zanzibar Channel, is considerably closer, as is the major Tanzanian mainland port of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dar es Salaam"]]},". Smaller islands surround the coast, notably Tumbatu in the northwest, Uzi in the south, and Mnemba Atoll in the northeast. A considerable number of smaller islands and reefs lie off Unguja's southwest coast.\n\nMany of Zanzibar's main centres are on Unguja, and most of the Zanzibari economy is also based here. Other than the capital, the island's major population centres include Mbweni, Mangapwani, Chwaka, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nungwi"]]},". Tourism is a major industry.\n\nThe island is rich in history, with numerous archaeological sites dotting the island, most notably at Unguja Ukuu, just to the north of the causeway which links Unguja and Uzi Islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nThere are many ferries and catamarans that can take you between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dar es Salaam"]]}," and the Island.

However, it will take around 4.5 hours whereas the others take 1.5 hours.\nThere are also evening departures on a slow night ferry. It runs towards the destination and anchors there until the morning before it enters the port.\nThis has been reported to be a beautiful trip, but security is an issue and close attention to belongings must always be paid.\n\nYou may be able to hire a private boat for cheaper, but the trip will take considerably longer and unless you know something about boats, you could be on a vessel that is not equipped for bad weather conditions or an emergency. Remember: you get what you pay for.\n\nWhile not advisable there are also ",{"type":"''","value":["dhow"]}," connections, e.g. to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bagamoyo"]]}," (4-8h, Tsh 5,000).

The trip is beautiful and lasts about two hours approximately. However, if the weather is bad it can take much longer and the trip can be very unpleasant.

They will say the company kiosk you are heading towards is closed, the ferry runs only later or only goes to mainland destinations (when they do service Zanzibar), they will say their service is a 90min ferry (when it actually takes over 2 hours), they will quote you a price for first class tickets (but issue \"e\/c\" economy tickets and pocket the difference), they will sell you a return ticket (leaving you to later find out it is actually only valid for return travel with a different, cheaper company and the seller has pocketed the difference).
