New Moscow was added to Moscow in 2012, forming Novomoskovky and Troitskiy Administrativniy Okrugs with plans of new vast expansion. New Moscow territory is yet to change according to its new city status. Even though suburbial kind construction intensifies in Novomoskovsky Administrativniy Okrug, Troitskiy Administrativniy Okrug still mostly has a rural feel.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nVnukovo and Ostafyevo airports are situated in New Moscow proper, though from Ostafyevo airport you still have to go through the \"old\" Moscow. It is possible to get from Sheremetyevo to Zelenograd without going to the old city - you have to change to 400 minibus on Leningrad highway or on local train on Planernaya. From Domodedovo airport you'll have to go through the old city anyway (the route through Domodedovo and Podolsk will take more time).\n\nLocal trains connect Zelenograd with Leningrad Train Station, Tver, Klin and Konakovo. Local trains from Kiev Train Station pass through northern part of New Moscow between Novoperedelkino and Krekshino. To go to Zosimova Pustyn you may want to go all the way to Bekasovo, but trains there are infrequent. It is possible to get to New Moscow through Podolsk, but you'll have to change to bus there.\n\nMost frequent bus to Zelenograd is bus 400 from Rechnoi Vokzal. It has special pricing.\nBuses are primary way of public transport to get to New Moscow, new buses are often added. Most buses start from Yugo-Zapadnaya and Tepliy Stan metroes, and Podolsk train station. Troitsk serves as a bus hub.\n\nZelenograd is accessible by M10 highway. Major highways in New Moscow are M3, A101, Warsaw highway Podolsk - Kresty (joining with A101), first \"Beton Ring\" A107 and Borovsk highway Peredelkino - Vnukovo - to join with M3. M10 and A101 are often highly congested, M3 may be less prone to it, except Moscow vicinity, and crossing with A107, A107 is congested near M3 crossing, which is northwest of New Moscow; Warsaw highway is congested in Podolsk, and you'll have to pass congested M2 to get there from MKAD.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Ostaf'yevo estate and museum."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Zosimova pustyn'."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Voskresenki estate in Ptichnoe village."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Valuevo estate (no admission)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Voronovo estate."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Talalikhin monument."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Ugresha Monastery"],["alt=Николо-Угрешский монастырь"],["url=http:\/\/ugresha.org\/"],["email= ugresha@rambler.ru"],["address= - Dzerzhinsky suburb, Svyatitelya Nikolaya ploshchad(пл.
