The crane viewing area is a short walk from the entrance.  The cranes are kept in enclosures there, but are released to fly free and eat food four times a day.  As of August 2010, the cranes were released at 10:10, 11:10, 2:30, and 3:30 but times may change.\nDon't let the fact that the birds are kept in pens dissuade you.  As you walk out to the crane viewing area, you can spot ducks, terns, herons, geese, and many other birds.  It's not like a zoo or an aviary, and when you see the cranes fly over your head it's amazing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nMosquito repellent is a must!!!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Heilongjiang"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Zhalong Nature Reserve"]]}]
