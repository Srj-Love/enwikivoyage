Since mid-2012, there are two passenger stations in the Zhangzhou metropolitan area: Zhangzhou Railway Station and Zhangzhou East Railway Station.\n\nThe new Zhangzhou Railway Station (which was known as Zhangzhou South during the planning stage) sits on the new high-speed railway  about 10 km south of downtown Zhangzhou. It has fairly decent rail service, since both the frequent high-speed trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xiamen"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fuzhou"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Longyan"]]}," and many of the conventional trains from Xiamen to all destinations have to pass through there. The high-speed Xiamen-Shenzhen line is now open, and the high-speed trains travelling along the coast from Xiamen (and points north) to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]}," via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shantou"]]}," stop here as well.\n\nThe older Zhangzhou East Railway Station is remarkably inconveniently located (miles away from the city, with few signs posted along the road, and fairly limited bus service; even some of the locals have only a vague idea as to where it is). Before the opening of the new Zhangzhou Railway Station all trains between Xiamen and the rest of China had to pass through this station. Now many of them have been rerouted to the new rail line south of the city and the new Zhangzhou Railway Station, but some (slower) trains still run through Zhangzhou East.\n\nFinally, there is the Zhangzhou North Station, just north of downtown Zhangzhou. Don't go there: even though older maps still call it \"Zhangzhou Station\" (this is how it was called until 2011), it has no passenger service anymore.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nTake a bus to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nanjing County"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yongding County"]]},", and see Fujian Tulou, large fortified earth buildings which are on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"]]},".
