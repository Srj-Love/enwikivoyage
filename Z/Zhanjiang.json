Now it is a rapidly developing modern city. Many people in Zhanjiang speak Mandarin (普通话 Pǔtōnghuà) with a fairly strong accent, the native languages for most locals are Cantonese (广东话 Guǎngdōnghuà) and Leizhouhua (雷州话 Léizhōuhuà), a distinctly different dialect close to Hainanese.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nZhanjiang is at the base of the Leizhou peninsula that points toward the island province ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hainan"]]},". Travellers often pass through Zhanjiang en route to Hainan. There are trains and buses to and from nearby mainland cities and boats to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haikou"]]},", capital of Hainan.  The boat is an hour bus ride away from Zhanjiang.\n\nThere are three train stations and a small airport that service Zhanjiang. Buses also run daily to most nearby cities. \n\nA bus runs daily from Zhanjiang to Hong Kong (8 hours) via Shenzhen and tickets are ¥280 at the travel agency's office in Chikan District.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nZhanjiang is almost like two cities combined. The northern half, composed of Chikan district (赤坎区 Chìkǎn qū) and Mazhang District (麻章区 Mázhāng qū) and the southern Xiashan District (霞山区 Xiáshān qū) are separated by a less developed corridor. \n\nThe main bus routes (2, 11, 12, 22) travel from the northern districts to Xiashan and back. Smaller buses and other routes can allow you to explore more areas of the individual districts. \n\nTaxis in Zhanjiang are fairly cheap, starting at ¥5. Afterwards the fare increases by ¥2 per kilometer. Please note that there is an additional ¥1 fuel surcharge that will be added onto your final fare.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Haibin Park"],["alt=海滨公园 hǎibīn gōngyuán"],["url="],["email="],["address=Xiashan District"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=You can easily get to the park on a number 2 bus"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A famous waterfront park."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cunjin Park"],["alt=寸金公园 cùn jīn gōngyuán"],["url="],["email="],["address=Chikan District"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Runs adjacent to Cunjin Bridge, which marks the historical boundary between the French treaty port and China"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Dragon Boat Festival"],["alt=端午节 duānwǔjié"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=The fifth day of the fifth month according to the lunar calendar"],["price="],["content=A large international boat race."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Huguangyan Park"],["alt=湖光岩世界地质公园 Húguāngyán shìjiè dìzhì gōngyuán"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=About 30 minutes from Zhanjiang"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Adults ¥50"],["content=The center piece to this UNESCO Geo Park is a large Maar Lake."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Movie theaters"],["url="],["email="],["address=Xiashan District"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Admission is usually around ¥25"],["content=There are a few movie theaters"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Bowling alley"],["url="],["email="],["address=Xiashan District"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=bowling alley now closed"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Haibin Hotel and Hotsprings"],["url="],["email="],["address=Xiashan District"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Admission includes a dinner buffet and an evening to enjoy the various hotsprings and pools."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Body Sculpture Fitness Club"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=behind Chikan Nursery"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Three month memberships cost ¥288"],["content=For those looking to exercise, this gym recently moved to a new location and upgraded most of its equipment."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nAs a major stop for many bikers heading to the islands, Zhanjiang has a fair range of bicycle shops to shop on components and parts.
