It's full of old wooden buildings, wind and rain bridges, and drum towers, and surrounded by beautiful scenery.  It's had a bit of the government sponsored \"Chinese Minority Village\" makeover, but is nowhere near as reconstructed as the other towns in the vicinity.\n\nThe local people will refer to this place as Shaoxing and having the name written down will be useful.\n\nThe new motorway is now finished and open to traffic.  The nearest exit is Congjiang East which is just outside a town called Luoxiang (洛香) which itself is less than 10km from Zhaoxing, although the road between the two is currently in a terrible condition (probably due to the high volume of construction vehicles passing through the area).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nAll access is by bus.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaili"]]}]},". Take the bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Congjiang"]]}," (and consider stopping off either there or at the nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Langde"]]}," on the way) costs 55Y and takes about 7 hours.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Congjiang"]]}]},".  There are direct buses which take around 2 1\/2 hours and cost ¥15.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanjiang"]]}]},".  Take the bus at HeXi bus station (河西汽车站), it takes around 3 1\/2 hours and costs ¥32.\n\nIt is possible to fly into Liping (via Guiyang) and take a bus to Zhaoxing. The ride is about 2 hours.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nIt's a small town - walk!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:ZhaoxingDrumTower.jpg"],["thumb"],["Zhaoxing Drum Tower"]]},"\n\nThere are five old wooden drum towers and a few old wind and rain bridges scattered throughout town. They're best discovered by wandering through the back streets.\n\nYou can hike through the rice paddies above the town.  Guest-houses will be able to help with directions.  The walk up the valley is particularly picturesque.\n\nThere's a lovely 3km walk from Zhaoxing up to the nearby village of Jitang (紀堂).  And it is consistently uphill.  They've a drum tower, nice old houses and a lot of peace and quiet and the villagers are lovely.  There is at least one home-stay open there too - ask at the shops near the drum tower square for directions.  The route from Zhaoxing is reasonably well signposted. Exit the village at the south east gate then follow the signs. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nThere is a surprisingly enjoyable nightly performance by the villagers of local songs and plays.  You can buy tickets for at your guesthouse.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThere are many small restaurants attached to guesthouses.  Try not to eat the street food. One suggestion would be for someone to bring their own food if possible through this area if one does not like much in the way of local Chinese food or are on a special diet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nMost guesthouses and restaurants serve beer.  There's a bar with a particularly fine view of town where the main road crosses the river in the middle of town. There is a KTV in the community, and a bar\/restaurant next door with a second floor balcony overlooking the main road that serves cold local Guizhou beer and some western liquor (like perhaps Jack Daniels and some Vodka). This is a community, and not a \"party spot\" with most of the people going indoors by dark.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThere are a plethora of identikit guesthouses to choose from.\n\nThe sole hotel is the aptly named Zhaoxing Hotel.  There are two branches.  The cheaper branch is in the middle of town at the back of the square where the buses stop.  The second, more expensive, branch is by the Rantuan Roofed bridge.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Dong Village Family Hotel"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Small family hotel and restaurant.

There's no direct bus any more.  Take the bus which passes through the village towards Sanjiang at around 8AM.  It costs 16Y and takes you as far as a weak bridge. Change here to a Sanjiang bound bus.  The road on the Zhaoxing side of the bridge is OK, but due to the construction traffic for the new motorway and express train tracks it's clogged with lorries. On the Guangxi side it's being resurfaced sporadically as of September 2009 - by the look of it, it will be complete by Christmas.  It takes around 4 hours from Zhaoxing to Sanjiang in total.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"''","value":["Zhaoxing to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guilin"]]}]},".  Take the 8AM bus as above.  Once at the bridge change to the Guilin bus.  You'll have to be quick as they fill up fast.  If you miss the direct Guilin bus take the Sanjiang bound bus and let the bus driver know you want to go to Guilin, and another bus will magically be waiting for you outside Sanjiang.\n\nFrom \"Zhaoxing to Congjiang\" meets at 0730 near the drum tower. Look for 从江(Congjiang) on the bus. From Congjiang, one may travel to most destinations in the region.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Guizhou"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Guizhou"]]}]
