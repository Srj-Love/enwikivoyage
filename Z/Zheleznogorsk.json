In 1992 Russia's President Yeltsin permitted the secret cities to reveal themselves and use traditional names; Krasnoyarsk-26 came out as the \"closed city\" of Zheleznogorsk.\n\nAlthough the nuclear industry is gradually being down-sized due to safety and non-proliferation pressures, in 1996 the residents voted to remain a closed city in an attempt to maintain their town's charming, village-like quality amidst harsher, more environmentally damaged cities. Built on a picturesque artifical lake, the town is said to resemble ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. Petersburg"]]},".

The more scenic route is to take the near-three-day train from Moscow to Krasnoyarsk: The \"Yenesei\" No. 56 departs Kazan train station every other day and winds its way eastward through the vast countryside reaching the Krasnoyarsk train station at early on the third day of travel. The cost of a sleeping car for this trip is RR2000 (~US$81).\n\nFrom Krasnoyarsk, bus route #521 links Yemelyanovo airport to Zheleznogorsk. The Icarus Company provides a daily shuttle on this route from the airport at a cost of RR30. The departing time is 8:30AM and arrives in Zheleznogorsk at approximately 11AM. Taxi service from the airport to Zheleznogorsk costs about RR500 (~US$20). Public buses traveling between the cities of Krasnoyarsk and Zheleznogorsk provide daily service at half-hour intervals from 6AM to 9:30PM. Buses No. 502 and 503 also depart the train station for Zheleznogorsk about every 30 minutes. This 90-minute trip costs RR18.
