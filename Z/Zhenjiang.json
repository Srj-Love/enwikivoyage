It can therefore be easily reached from either by both regular train and the faster ",{"type":"[[","value":[["CRH"]]}," bullet trains. The cost ranges from ¥13-30 (regular train) to ¥30-75 (bullet train).\n\nZhenjiang is also easily reached by bus from other nearby cities. Buses are slightly cheaper than the train, but can take up to twice as long to reach their destination.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nTaxis are the most convenient while buses are the most affordable.  The base fare for a taxi is ¥8, and most areas of the city can be reached from the Zhenjiang Railroad Station for less than ¥30.

Entrance to each park is ¥30-50, and the parks with pagodas charge another entrance fee (about ¥10) if you wish to climb the pagoda.\n\nJiaoshan Park is located on a small island in the Yangtze River and includes a large pagoda, peacock farm, and many winding paths through dense foliage. Bamboo forests partially cover the island.\n\nJinshan Park is located on the Northwest side of Zhenjiang and includes another large pagoda. The Buddhist temple complex and a large lake (complete with paddle boats available for rent) form the majority of the park.\n\nBeigushan Park is located on the North side of Zhenjiang and has paths lit with lanterns after sundown. The park is surrounded by great landscaping and the Yangtze River.\n\nNanshan Park is located on the South side of Zhenjiang. It includes a hill with various paths snaking up and down it. A large pagoda at the top of the hill offers great views of the city, the river, and the surrounding countryside. The climb is very easy and takes less than an hour. Many people barbecue at small pits next to a lake to the East of the park entrance.\n\nThe parks are all nice, but unfortunately, if you've seen one \"park\" in the city, you've seen them all. Jiaoshan is enjoyable if you want to get away from people (it's nearly empty all the time), and Jinshan is nice if you want to boat around the lake (paddle and electric boats are available). Nanshan is currently being renovated (early 2008) and will hopefully be greatly improved.\n\nAll parks have legend history. Jinshan park, which famous for \"mountain encompassed by temples (寺裹山)\", is a remarkable place in ancient novel WHITE SNAKE (白蛇传), where is flooded by white snake (who is half woman and half snake with great super-natural power) for the revenge of a Buddhist who imprison her husband. Beigushan park, which nears Yangtze river, is well known for the real story of Three Kingdom (三国), where Liu Bei and Sun Quan (the ruler of two kingdoms) took the horse ride together, discussed the union plan and ultimately changed China history forever. Jiaoshan park is famous for \"temples encompassed by mountains(山裹寺)\" and connected to a history that people bravely resisted British invasion. Few iron cannons still left there if search carefully. \n\nXiJinDu Ancient Street, which address below, is a newly man made ancient place and a well spot to know the ancient zhenjiang buildings and culture.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=XiJinDu Ancient Street"],["alt=西津渡"],["url="],["email="],["address=Foothills of Yuntai Mountain, Jingkou District"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Number 2 Bus from DaShiKou (downtown, in front of Pizza Hut)"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Zhulin Si"],["alt=竹林寺"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Bamboo forest temple located in the folder.
