Once you've finished fishing, you can take your catch to the large grills, skewer 'em live and watch them crack under the flames. Then pack on the salt, order some stir-fry vegetables and enjoy your mean.\n\nThere are a couple, but the best one is near Jing-An MRT. Turn right out of Exit one and follow the overpass down the main street. Keep going for 5–10 minutes until you get just past BanAn road intersection.
