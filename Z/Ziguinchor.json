It is an overnight ferry ride, taking about 16 hours.  It leaves Dakar Tuesday and Friday afternoon, making the return trip (Ziguinchor - Dakar) Thursday & Sunday. The boat has 'pullman' style seating (CFA 15.500), as well as shared cabins of 8, 4, & 2 (expect CFA 60.000). Book as early as you can, especially in the travel season, as it is frequently sold out. There is a restaurant on board as well as a small bar which also sells snacks.\n\nALL passengers are required to show their original passport or other form of identification when purchasing their ticket at either the Dakar or the Ziguinchor terminals.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:ZiguinchorCasamance.JPG"],["thumb"],["View of the Casamance River at Ziguinchor"]]},"\nFrom Dakar, one can also drive to Ziguinchor via the Transgambian highway, crossing the Gambia River at the Farafenni ferry.

When crossing the border in Gambia, officials will stamp your passport. If you are white and have a European or US passport, they will most likely try to charge you for the stamp, anything from 1.000 to 10.000 CFA (this especially happens at Farafenni, much less likely in Amdallai). Demanding for a proof of payment and threatening to contact the embassy in Banjul will probably get your passport back without having to pay. In any case, it is evident that remaining polite and showing respect will be the most effective way to communicate with border officials.\nQuality of roads is very bad from Fatick via Kaolack to some distance before the Gambian border in Karang\/Amdallai. If coming with a car, arrive as early as possible to cross to Banjul on the ferry, it has very limited capacity and traverses the river only 4 times a day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:ZiguinchorCathédrale.JPG"],["thumb"],["Ziguinchor Cathedral"]]},"\nA single stop taxi ride (regardless of the number of passengers) costs 500 CFA anywhere within Zig.
