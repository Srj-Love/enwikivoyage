The airport is serviced by direct flights from Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Houston, plus Mexico City and Vancouver (seasonally).\n\nZihuatanejo is also well served by long-distance luxury buses from such places as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Acapulco"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Morelia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico City"]]},".

Several lovely beaches surround the bay, including the Playa La Ropa (\"Beach of the clothes\") and the Playa Las Gatas (\"Beach of the she-cats\"), the first named after a shipwreck including Chinese silk, the latter named after little, harmless sharks called \"she-cats\" because of their whiskers. \n\nPlaya Las Gatas, across the bay from town, is reached by lanchas, open boats. You buy the tickets at the ticket counter, and queue up at the pier. This is usually a quick affair. The beach itself has white sands and plenty of palapas (thatched umbrellas). You sit down under one for free, as long as you order your drinks and your lunch from the owner of the palapa. Snorkeling is recommended from the snorkel shop located just off of the boat dock.  A very nice artificial reef was created in precolumbian times.\n\nThe small community amphitheater and basketball courts provide great evening weekend events.  Located along the pier near the fish market local families will attend Friday night basketball games (summer timeframe) and Sunday celebrations to watch folkloric dancing on the stage. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nA true Mexican tourist resort (i.e. a lot of vacationers from Mexico City), there are loads of things to buy in Zihuatanejo. In addition to swimwear and other beach accessories, you can buy a lot of Mexican handicraft. There is of course anything from cheap junk to high-quality artworks.\n\nVisit the shops and market close to the Playa Municipal, fanning outward from the pier.
