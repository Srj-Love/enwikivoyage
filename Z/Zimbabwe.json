UN sanctions and a guerilla struggle finally led to both free elections and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980.

This is a society with deep gender divisions.\n\nWhen shaking hands or handing anything valuable to someone, it is polite to support the right forearm with the left hand (or vice versa), to signify the \"weight\" of the gift or honour. In practice this often means just touching the forearm, or even gesturing towards it.\n\nWhen taking something from a local, it is strictly done with the right hand as it is seen as an insult if the left hand is used regardless of dexterousness. The same rule applies when passing something.\n\nBe careful with your opinion as speaking out against the government is a crime.\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-17.8333"],["31.0500"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Southern_Africa"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Zimbabwe"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Africa\/Zimbabwe\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:category:Zimbabwe"]]}]
