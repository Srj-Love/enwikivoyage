The bus makes frequent stops, about every hour and a half, and a stopover is long enough to buy street food or hit the toilet. SNTV line is the premier one -- they even have a brand new bus, with air-conditioning. It costs 12,500 francs from Niamey, and the return trip is 11,500. \"Air\" is another good bus line -- they even hand out snacks on the trip. \"Rimbo\" and the others are sometimes quicker but more dangerous because driving fast in a country with tons of livestock is pretty scary.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nCabou-cabous (motorcycles; \"taxi-motos\", in French) are scary, but pretty much the only hired ride available to get around. There are maybe two taxi cabs, but you see them once in a blue moon. The cost of a cabou-cabou ranges anywhere from 150 francs for a short distance to 200 francs for longer ones. They don't have helmets, and don't worry about finding one.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nNot much to see in the city, except maybe the 'Sultan's Palace', a pretty cool building.

Called 'Dead Man's' because Nigeriens assume that the only person who'd give away perfectly good clothing is a dead man, chances are you might see the logo of your own college or high school on a shirt. Shirts from Nigeria are also interesting, sporting Sadaam and Osama Bin Laden. Funny, but unwearable in the US, most likely.\n\nAnother great place is the Artisan Center, located in Zinder's southeast area, on the road to Maradi. There you can find leather-workers, silver-smiths, tailors and a store that sells shoes, wallets, silver, paintings, etc. If you are in Zinder, you ",{"type":"'''","value":["must"]}," go to this place. Be sure to haggle though, because they usually charge close to double of what you can get them down to. If you go to the silver-smith Moumouni and say you're friends with Chewbacca, it might be easier to haggle, since I've bought a bunch from him.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nMany good restaurants.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chez Ramatou"]},", located near Hotel Damagaram and the post office, sells street food with great sauce and has everything from cous-cous to rice and beans.
