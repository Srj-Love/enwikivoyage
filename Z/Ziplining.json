[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\nZip Lining (also known as ziplining) is a sport that has become popular in recent years.  Zip lining consist of participants “zipping” between platforms on a series of cables.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nZip line courses can consist of one or many cables that are suspended between trees or man-made structures.  Participants (often referred to as “zippers”) are suspended from a pulley that moves across the cable, propelled by gravity.  The cables are mounted descending from a higher to lower point.  The amount of incline as well as the weight of the zipper determines the speed at which the participant travels from point to point.\n\nZip line courses can be designed purely for speed (adrenaline rush), while others are designed to allow zippers to enjoy the natural surroundings such as forest, jungle or waterfalls (often referred to as canopy tours).  While others employ elements of both.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Glossary"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Zippers: The name given to zip line participants"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Zipping: The action of zip lining.\t"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Flying: Another term used to describe the act of zip lining"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Guides: Professionals who accompany groups of zippers through the zip line course."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\nProfessional zip line courses offer mandatory training sessions for participants.  During the training sessions guides teach participants, proper form, how to take off from a platform, how to land on a platform and how to break\/slow down.

It is also important to keep in mind that courses have different age, health and weight requirements, so check with the tour provider before heading out for your adventure.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nIt is likely you will get all of the gear you need from the zip line operator including gloves, harnesses and helmets.

Professional US zip line courses often have double cables, ensuring that if one cable is compromised, a second will continue to carry the zipper.  It is also important to adhere to all safety requirements given during the training session and to advise guides of any health issues.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["With Children"]},"\nCourses have different age an weight requirements, so check with the course operator before heading out on your adventure.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Destinations"]},"\nZip Line courses include:\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alaska"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Alaska Zipline Adventure"],["url=http:\/\/www.alaskazip.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree= (740)385-1627"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["California"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Sonoma Canopy Tours"],["url=http:\/\/sonomacanopytours.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Colorado"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Captain Zipline"],["url=http:\/\/captainzipline.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hawaii"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Kapalua Adventures"],["url=http:\/\/kapaluaadventures.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Idaho"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tamarack Canopy Zipline Tour"],["url=http:\/\/tamarackzipline.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Georgia (state)"],["Georgia"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Lake Lanier Canopy Tours"],["url=http:\/\/lakelaniercanopytours.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["North Carolina"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=ZipQuest Waterfall & Treetop Adventure"],["url=http:\/\/zipquest.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Ohio"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Hocking Peaks Adventure Park"],["url=http:\/\/hockingpeakspark.com\/"],["email="],["address= St. Rt. 664 South, Logan, Ohio"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Texas"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Lake Travis Zipline Adventures"],["url=http:\/\/www.ziplaketravis.com\/"],["email="],["address= 14529 Pocahontas Trail Leander, Texas 78641"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]}]},{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Zip-line"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Sport"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinetopic"]]}]
