In 1962 the village had around 10 000 habitants. March 2008 brought the 120 000th habitant. Nowadays, the city is no longer a so-called satellite city of The Hague but a city of its own.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Zoetermeer De Leyens Hoekerkade (01).JPG"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Zoetermeer is a large but peaceful residential town in the Haaglanden"]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:2008 Station Zoetermeer (01).JPG"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["The Zoetermeer train station is served both by NS, Randstadrail and a number of local bus lines"]]},"\nBeing set up as a commuter city, Zoetermeer has a good infrastructure.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrom the A12 highway, take the \"Zoetermeer-Oost\" or \"Zoetermeer-Centrum\" exit.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nFrom The Hague you can take the sprinter train to Gouda or Utrecht.

The \"randstadrail\" runs throughout the whole city. Parts that are not covered by it are easily reachable by bus.\n\nWhen coming from The Hague or Utrecht you probably end up at Zoetermeer train station (note that it is not advised to stop at Zoetermeer-Oost, since there are no good connections from there). Walk across the footbridge to another platform. There, you will find the Randstadrail, which brings you to \"Zoetermeer Centrum West\". All buses depart here. You can also find here the police station, shops and town hall.\n\nYou can buy a ticket on the bus by the driver: note that this is quite expensive, between 2 and 4 euro for a one-way ticket! Like the rest of the Netherlands, all busses, trams and trains otherwise require the OV-chipkaart. These can be bought at most trainstations, kiosks and some supermarkets. The cost of a blank card is 10 euro, and after that you will have to top them up in special machines.\n\nThe \"randstadrail\" has ticket machines, BUT they will only take coins. If you don't have any, or the machine is broken, walk up to the conductors as soon as they come in. If you are a foreigner, they will either let it be, or require you to buy a (more expensive) ticket with them. Probably the first option though.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Zoeterm.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["The old village centre of Zoetermeer is small, but can be picturesque"]]},"\nBeing such a young city there is not a lot of old stuff to see:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The old church"]},"\nAt the crossing of the Dorpsstraat\/Vlamingstraat you can find the oldest church.
