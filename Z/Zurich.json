It is the financial centre of Switzerland and houses the stock exchange and the headquarters of a large number of national and international companies. National and international media agencies as well as most of the national TV channel companies are also located here. Because Zurich is the central node of the Swiss-wide train network and also runs the biggest and busiest international airport in the country, it generally is the first place where tourists arrive. Because of the city's close distance to tourist resorts in the Swiss Alps and its mountainous scenery, it is often referred to as the \"portal to the Alps\".\n\nContrary to what some believe, Zurich is ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," the capital of Switzerland-- that honor falls to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berne"]]},". Zurich has long been known for being clean and efficient. Due to this, it has been continuously ranked as the city with the highest living standard world-wide for many years.

The most common dialect is called Züritüütsch. English and French are also widely spoken and often used in official publications and announcements alongside German. Any of these languages will do easily.

The network includes trams, buses, S-Bahn (suburban trains), cable cars and boats. The size and complexity of the network may be daunting at first, but you will soon realize that there are dozens of ways to get from one place to another and following any of them will still be efficient.\n\nTimetable information for Switzerland is available on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sbb.ch sbb.ch"]}," or can be obtained using the SBB Mobile ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/sbb-mobile\/id294855237?mt=8 iPhone"]}," or ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=ch.sbb.mobile.android.b2c Android"]}," App (requires a working internet connection).

There are single tickets, day cards, monthly cards and annual cards. The monthly and annual cards are collectively referred to as ",{"type":"''","value":["ZVV NetzPass"]},".\n\nTickets must be purchased from a ticket vending machine before boarding or from one of the ticket selling kiosks. The ticket vending machines are in German, English, French and Italian and offer almost all regular tickets available (not personal tickets though). You select the zones you wish to pass through upon buying the ticket, with a zone map on every machine as well as clear instructions coming to your aid, so feel free to choose! Once you've got your ticket it gives you access to all modes of transport.\n\nIf you're staying for a longer period, consider a monthly ZVV NetzPass, because even though there are no regular tickets valid for something between 1 day and a month, it takes only 10 zone 110 day cards for a zone 110 monthly card to be cheaper. When travelling in all zones, it takes only 8 day cards for the monthly card to be cheaper. A 24-hour ticket for zone 110 costs just the same as two single rides.\n\nIf you don't mind starting your travels after 9:00, the \"ZVV-9-UhrPass\" is the best option. It is available as both daily, monthly and annual cards and will save you a lot of money compared to regular similarities, especially given that the 9:00 rule does not apply on weekends.\n\nThere are also so-called Z-passes, which can be used not only in Zürich, but also in one of the neighbouring cantons (Aargau, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, Zug, St. Gallen or Thurgau); however, only one additional canton is possible, so if you're not going to one neighbouring canton more often than the others you are probably better off with just a normal all zones Zürich monthly card and buying single ticket from the last valid station to your final destination. The Z-pass system also has its zones, even in the neighbouring cantons. It is only available as monthly and annual cards and can not be bought from ticket vending machines.\n\nFor all details regarding fares, see ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.zvv.ch"]}," (in German) or ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.zvv.ch\/en"]}," (in English)\n\nThe Swiss Pass is valid on all public transport in Zurich and, if you are a tourist visiting most of Switzerland, this may be your best way to saving both money and time spent trying to figure out zones, routes, and fare options. Eurail passes are valid only on the S-Bahn and boats. Interrail passes are valid on the S-Bahn (although the ZVV website claims a \"reduction\" for other routes for Interrail holders).

In particular, thieves are known to operate around the Zurich main train station. Do not let your bags out of sight for even a moment.\n\nIn recent years, certain areas along the lakefront are frequented by young people who sometimes try to pick a fight when they are drunk. Do not let them provoke you, as they are likely to be there in numbers and will use any excuse to go at you. You may also notice many of said young people smoking something that isn't a cigarette - Switzerland is surprisingly lenient about such things - but it is hardly a cause for alarm.\n\nPublic transport is very safe. You can use it without any special precautions.\n\nIf you decide to bicycle in the city, understand that Zurich is a city of public transport . Beware of tram tracks which can get your wheel stuck and send you flying into traffic, of the trams themselves which travel these tracks frequently (and may scare you into getting stuck into the track as just noted), and the buses, which make frequent stops in the rightmost lane.

Ambulance phone number is 144.\n\nIf you're on a budget, don't stay out too late — the \"N\" night buses only run on weekends. When they run, they run only once per hour and you must purchase a Nachtzuschlag for 5 CHF from the machine and validate it before boarding. On work nights, there is no public transport at all after about 12:30AM (although expensive taxis still exist in case you're stuck).\n\nStores are generally closed on Sundays including all supermarkets in the city, except those in the main train station and airport.\n\nOn Sundays, there are supermarkets open at the following train stations: Zurich main station, Enge, and Stadelhofen.\n\nAvoid reaching\/visiting Zurich on 1 May. The city is on a Labor Day\/May Day holiday. The trams don't run for half the day so getting around could be a problem. Also, there could be some minor violent outbreaks and damages to cars.\n\nZurich has two police departments, the Stadtpolizei Zurich which is responsible for the city area and the Kantonspolizei Zürich which is responsible for the whole region. With approximately 1'800 and 3'000 officers, these corps are the biggest in Switzerland. While police officers in Zurich will happily help you out if you are in trouble or need an information, they are also known for approaching \"suspicious\" persons in order to check their papers.
