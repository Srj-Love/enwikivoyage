The small river Berkel (no shipping possible) as well as the major Twentekanaal (channel) flow into the IJssel near Zutphen. The city lies at the border of the hilly forested Veluwe region and the more flat and agricultural Achterhoek.\nThe language spoken is Dutch; nearly everyone speaks English, and German is widely understood.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nIt is easily accessible by train from most major cities.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From Amsterdam"]},"\n\nIn the morning: Take the Intercity from Amsterdam Central to direction Nijmegen till Arnhem, the you have to change train.
